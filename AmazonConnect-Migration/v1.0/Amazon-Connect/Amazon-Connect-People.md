Mission Statement
=================

Contact center leadership, culture, and change perspective is critical to establishing an organization’s cloud fluency and readiness to execute an enterprise-wide contact center transformation effort.

As determined in contact center discovery, preparing for contact center transformation requires the organization to have people with relevant AWS expertise, established operational processes, and a leadership team dedicated to mobilizing the appropriate resources.  Leading teams through the many organizational and transformational challenges presented over the course of a large-scale change effort is essential.  Based on many years of experience leading and advising enterprises across a wide array of industries, AWS has found that organizational adoption of change and political and cultural impact are the most challenging and underestimated roadblocks to cloud adoption success. 

We have developed this workstream with focus understanding the contact center resource composition and deep dive on roles and responsibilities as an accelerator to resource transformation.

Objectives
==========

*   Design the team responsible for mobilizing contact center resources
    
*   Establish a dedicated team with single-threaded ownership and set functional areas of the core team to be managed throughout the migration journey
    
*   Customer core team designed for leading and executing a readiness and migration project
    
*   Educate on the impact to culture and the critical role of transformational leadership
    
*   Ensure that impacted employees understand their new role and are able and ready to utilize the tools and technology implemented
    
*   Design and help implement the optimal supporting organizational structure for a post-contact center migration Amazon Connect environment

Key Milestones
==============

People & Change

*   Team composition clearly defined before, during, and post migration
    
*   Leaders are aligned and actively promoting contact center migration and transformation
    
*   Proactive People Plans are in place (Communications, Training, Adoption, RACi)
    

Risks
=====

*   Lack of alignment across Leaders
    
*   Lack of active, visible sponsorship from Leaders
    
*   Unmanageable culture clash between old and new
    
*   Failing to engage at the appropriate level of the organization (top)
    
*   Failing to present as one united team (partner delivery resources, AWS delivery resources, account teams, customer delivery resources, etc.)
    
*   Desired business outcomes not achieved fast enough
    
*   Reduced financial return from Amazon Connect contact center migration investment
    
*   Potential for business disruption if not operationally ’ready’ for the contact center migration and transformation
