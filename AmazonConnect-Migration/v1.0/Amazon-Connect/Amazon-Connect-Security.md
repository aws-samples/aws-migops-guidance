**Mission** 
============

The security perspective goal is to help customers structure the selection and implementation of controls that are right for the contact centers organization. The directive, preventive, detective, and responsive components of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) security perspective organize the principles that will help drive and transform contact center security standards.

**Objectives**
==============

The security perspective provides a recommended initial configuration for the following:

*   Review Amazon Connect security guidelines
*   Review data security in Amazon Connect
*   Develop regional strategy that aligns with customers data sovereignty restrictions
*   Architect solutions based on guidelines and customers specific compliance requirements

**Outcomes**
============

*   Customer has a defined IAM model and has provisioned IAM resources
*   Customer has a defined logging source model and has implemented logging
*   Customer has a defined centralized logging model and has implemented the solution
*   Customer has a defined data protection model and has implemented data protection controls

**Key Milestones**
==================

*   Define per-account IAM roles and policies
*   Implement per-account IAM roles and policies
*   Define account federation mechanism
*   Implement account federation mechanism
*   Establish data protection (encryption, access controls) controls
*   Implement security controls to enforce data protection (encryption, access controls) requirements
*   Define the security controls that warrant detection
*   Implement detection controls
*   Define the security controls that warrant responsive action
*   Implement responsive controls
*   Define account-specific infrastructure automation baselines and mechanism (CloudFormation, Service Catalog, automated)
*   Implement security baselines

**Risks**
=========

*   Customer does not have existing security policies, standards, and guidelines.
*   Logging capabilities could merit additional attention

**Decisions**
=============

*   Decision on Root and IAM Users management
    
*   Decision on Multi-Account User Authentication Policy
    
*   Decision on Monitoring Services
    
*   Decision on Preventative Security Controls
