*   Significance:
    
    *   Allows agents to log into [Salesforce.com](http://Salesforce.com) (SFDC) and the Contact Control Panel (CCP) in one single application to do all their work and take calls in one place
    *   Allows the system to proactively pop open windows for accounts or cases, tasks, etc… for the agent which then reduces the agent handle time when using this feature in SFDC
    *   Also retrieve reporting data and play back recordings in SFDC so you don’t have to go into Amazon Connect, which makes it a one stop shop
    *   Allows you to perform self-service in the IVR which for example: will allow you to check the status of SFDC case
*   Utilize the following sample use case for Migration/Project Planning
