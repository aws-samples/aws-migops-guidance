**Mission Statement**
---------------------

The Mobilize for Amazon Connect engagement is where we build an AWS architecture, migration plan, and mobilize businesses to migrate and/or support ongoing operations of their contact centers. Mobilize takes the information obtained during the Contact Center Migration Readiness Assessment (CCMRA) and helps customers build the foundation for a successful migration, from training on AWS technology to helping establish updated security processes and operational systems to take advantage of Amazon Connect and the AWS cloud.

The Mobilize for Amazon Connect engagement uses accelerators to deliver the following outputs/outcomes for customers:

1.  Collect contact center baseline and landscape to assess the portfolio and develop decision criteria to create initial migration wave plans.
    
2.  Deploy and validate environments, Amazon Connect instances, etc., develop required operating and governance models, and migrate small and internal LOBs to the customer production environment.
    
3.  Gain hands-on experience operating in the cloud to build confidence, skills, and competency for the migration and transformation of the organization.
    
4.  Define, implement, scale and automate (where applicable), the customer’s security risk and compliance controls on AWS.
    
5.  Establish the future operating model for cloud and plan, guide and support an efficient progression of the operational model during the migration.
    

These Accelerators generate early alignment, speed-up requirements gathering, and expedite first migrations to compress the overall engagement timeframe.
