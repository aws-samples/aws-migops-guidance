## AWS MigOps

AWS MigOps is a new experience and capabilities in AWS Migration Hub that streamlines migrations and helps execute migrations into AWS at scale. As part of this new experience, guidance for multiple templates would be available for customers. Templates and guidance would be made public for customers to leverage or create new versions of them.

#### General Migration

The general migration template can be used for any kind of migration such as rehost, refactor, rearchitect, etc. You can use the modules and tasks in this template as a basis to extend it to different kinds of migrations.
