Mission Statement
=================

**People & Change GSP focuses on Culture and Change Leadership Acceleration.**

We help our customers accelerate their AWS journey with Culture and Change Leadership strategies. We believe the value realization of cloud is dependent on the degree to which enterprise pays attention to their people - how they lead people through change and bring them along the cloud journey. Leveraging our experience across enterprise organizations, we offer prescriptive guidance based on lessons learned and best practices to help leaders enable their organization's AWS journey. 

**People & Change GSP owns the People Perspective of the Cloud Adoption Framework.**

The _people_ perspective of the Cloud Adoption Framework serves as a bridge between technology and business, accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning, and where change becomes business-as-normal, with focus on culture, organizational structure, leadership, and workforce. This perspective comprises seven capabilities shown in the following figure. Common stakeholders include CIO, COO, CTO, cloud director, and cross-functional and enterprise-wide leaders.

*   Neglecting to set deadlines and milestones related to cloud migration, modernization, data center exits, etc.
