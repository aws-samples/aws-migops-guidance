**Leadership Alignment Interview Guide**
----------------------------------------

**Why do we conduct leadership interviews?**

*   To assess effectiveness of Cloud Migration leadership communications and involvement activities and gauge consistency across the organization.
    
*   To ensure that organizational issues and potential risks are identified early in the Cloud Migration.
    
*   To define the amount and type of support required from the Cloud Migration project team during the change process.
    

**What are the expected outcomes of the interviews?**

*   Refine Cloud Migration sponsor, director, and team leader communication/involvement plans to address any communication gaps.
    
*   Clarify expectations about the level of sponsorship that is needed or expected.
    
*   Prepare leader action plans to assist leaders in communicating and demonstrating sponsorship.
    
*   Document issues around priorities, competing initiatives, resources or other high level risks.
    
*   Inform steering committee of issues around priorities, competing initiatives, resources or other high level risks
    

**Confidentiality**: Information from individual interviews will remain confidential within the Client Migration project leaders & managers. A summary of consolidated information will be presented back to senior managers, however, nothing that will be attributed to named individuals.

### **Interview Structure**

*   The interviews are scheduled for 30 to 60 minutes.
    
*   The interviews are informal in nature and need to be non-threatening as possible. If there are issues or misunderstandings, we need to take responsibility for them.
    
*   It is important to record thoughts and perceptions during the interview so plans can be assembled to deal with issues.
    
*   It is important to leave knowing what communication (frequency, medium, content) they expect and that they are comfortable with the next steps and follow up actions.
    

### **Interview Approach**

There are four sections to the interview that need quantitative scores so that we can compile a "snapshot" of global leadership alignment.

1.  Understanding of the Cloud Migration project
    
2.  Current issues and experience of change
    
3.  Leadership/Sponsorship Role
    
4.  Change Readiness and Culture
    

The quantitative scores are a summary of the interviewees' thoughts and comments. It is important to get their feedback and thoughts around the questions and conduct a rating for each section during the interview. This does not need to be shared with the interviewee during the interview. A summary of the interview with our assessment of the ratings will be provided to the interviewee for their comments. The questions are scored using the following scale:

*   5 High No issues
*   3 Medium May need some follow up
*   1 Low Risk area, definitely needs follow up
*   N/A Not Applicable

The final section of the interview covers the next steps and describes what use will be made of the information obtained. Any actions requiring follow up should be reiterated in this section.

### **Suggested Interview Opening - sample**

_**Discuss "what is the Cloud Migration"**_  
"The Cloud Migration creates **common global processes** and implements **common technology globally**. This is to **maximize the benefits** of the investment. The project will be rolled out in X waves over the next X months/years. The team is working on building a **Global process model.** With important initiatives such as the Cloud Migration, it is vitally important to prepare the people at the organization for the change. This preparation will be a continuous process throughout the cloud migration at every level in the organization."  
_**Discuss "why The Cloud Migration"**_  
"The Organization has made a **significant investment in the Cloud technology rollout** and has determined that employing technology in additional business units can **leverage this investment**. All of the organization's regional applications are highly customized to support local requirements. This customization means that our systems are expensive to maintain and cannot continue to serve as the backbone for our global future. It is absolutely critical that we address this situation immediately."  
_**Discuss "what is Leadership Alignment"**_  
"For this Cloud Migration to be successful we have to make sure that the key influencers and leaders within the organization are aligned around the changes. Specifically, there must be **common agreement on expectations, priority, timing, resource needs, and how this project fits into the overall organization's objectives**. Since leadership is so important to a project like this, we want to make sure that **key leaders have the right info and tools to be visible sponsors**. We are beginning to assess these areas during the planning phase of the project so we can determine where we need to focus our efforts in communications and involvement with the leaders. Once the current situation is understood, we will complete an approach and the associated action plans in an effort to institute the leadership alignment process."  
_**Discuss Interview Structure**_  
"The Leadership Alignment interviews are being conducted with IT leaders globally. The interviews are structured as a **series of intentionally open-ended questions** that focus on specific themes. This approach is intended to **facilitate wide ranging, but still relevant discussion during the interview** regarding issues, concerns, and suggestions.  
"We ask open ended questions to facilitate discussion. We want to hear **your thoughts and perspectives** and hope that this interview provides the framework to spark ideas and improve mutual understanding."  
"What questions do you have before we begin?"  
_**Discuss Next Steps**_  
"Once all of the leadership alignment interviews are complete we will develop a series of next steps based on the data gathered. We will be looking for areas where the Cloud Migration team needs to focus more attention and developing strategies and action plans for involving and communicating with our CLIENT leaders, thereby increasing our ability to succeed.  
"We will be **conducting a subjective "rating" of the different sections** so we can determine the level of effort to be spent on each area. These ratings **will be provided to you for your feedback following the interview**.  
"We will follow up with you to discuss results of the interviews and specific action plans. The format for these reviews will be determined after the results are analyzed from a global perspective."
