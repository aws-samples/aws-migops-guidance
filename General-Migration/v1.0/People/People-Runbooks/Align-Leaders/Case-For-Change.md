**Case for Change  
**
----------------------

### **What is it?**

Developing a case for Change helps the organization's leadership clarify the need for change and develop a clear, compelling message for change.  
It is not always necessary to conduct a formal Return on Investment (ROI) analysis. Although it is important to operationally define success. Developing the Case for Change helps you to:

*   Develop a clear description of the desired state with Cloud Transformation
    
*   Assess the impact of closing the gap between the current and future states
    
*   Assess the impact of not closing the gaps
    
*   Create an operational definition of success that is objective and measurable
    
*   Develop a compelling message that inspires and motivates Stakeholders to embrace and implement the change
    

### **Why is it important?**

As a leader, you need to effect changes that will enable your organization to succeed in current and future markets. Cloud Transformation must be tied to a strong business case, and you will need to communicate the vision in a way that generates commitment from Stakeholders. People will be resistant to change if they do not believe in what you are asking them to achieve. There is a big difference in performance between someone who "wants" to change and someone who changes because they "have to". A solid and well-communicated Case for Change goes a long way toward getting people to commit to the Cloud Transformation journey because they want to.

### **What do I need?**

*   Recognition from the senior-most leaders of the organization that a need for change exists based on current and expected business results
    
*   A multilevel and cross-functional team charged with identifying and defining the benefits of Cloud Transformation
    

### **Approach**

1.  **Define Current State**
    
2.  **Define Future State**
    
3.  **Define Impact of Closing and Not Closing the Gap**
    
4.  **Operationally Define Success**
    
5.  **Create a Compelling Case for Change**
    

  

#### **1\. Define Current State**

**In this step, the leadership team defines the current state of the organization relative to the benefits of Cloud Transformation.**

1.  Brainstorm a list of indicators that may be positively impacted by Cloud Transformation. To get as complete a picture as possible, identify at least 10-20 indicators. For example:
    

*   Customer satisfaction measures
    
*   Financial data
    
*   Technology capabilities
    
*   Employee satisfaction indicators
    
*   Description of effectiveness of key processes based on flowcharting of the current process and identification of problems or gaps
    
*   "silo" mentality across functions
    

2\. When available, include data to create an objective picture of the current state.

3\. List current-state indicators in column 1 of the Case for Change Template.

  

#### **2\. Define Future State**

**In this step, the leadership team defines the future state relative to Cloud Transformation.**  
Indicate how the current state indicators will be positively influenced by Cloud Transformation in column 2. Be sure to indicate how Cloud Transformation aligns with and compliments other business initiatives that may also be underway. When defining the future state, continually ask the question "How is Cloud Transformation going to help our business?" For Cloud Transformation, you may find it helpful to define the future state as both short term and longer term.

####   
**3\. Define Impact of Closing and Not Closing the Gap**

**In this step, the team examines the implications Cloud Transformation and the implications of staying on-premises, based on the identified indicators.**

1.  Brainstorm the impact of closing the gap between the current and future states. Consider the effects on customers, employees, and business results. Quantify the effects where possible. List the impact of closing the gap in column 3A.
    
2.  Brainstorm the impact of not closing the gap between the current and future states. Consider the effects on customers, employees, and business results. Quantify the effects where possible. List the impact of closing the gap in column 3B.
    

####   
**4\. Operational Success Metrics and Goals**

The goals of Cloud Transformation have to be very clear. They should be specific and answer who, what, when, where, how frequently, and why. Operationally defined goals do not contain hunches or speculationâ€”only measurable facts. These measures of success should reflect business performance.

Use the **SMART** criteria to assess your operational definition of success.

*   **S**pecific? The statement clearly states exactly what you want to achieve.
*   **M**easurable?I can provide measurable proof that success has been achieved.
*   **A**ligned? The statement is aligned with other change objectives and does not adversely affect other change activities.
*   **R**ealistic? The statement is challenging yet attainable.
*   **T**ime-oriented?The statement includes target dates for completion and checkpoints for progress review.

  

#### **5\. Create a Compelling Case for Change (from the Cloud Leader's Point of View)**

Creating a compelling message to communicate the case for change is an essential step to getting others in your organization to embrace the change.  
A. Use the following guidelines to prepare your message and check its effectiveness.

*   The message communicates the future state in simple, clear terms.
*   The message describes why the change is necessary by describing the current state and including the consequences for both beginning Cloud Transformation at this time and not beginning Cloud Transformation at this time.
*   The message describes how Cloud Transformation is aligned with other initiatives that improve business results.
*   The message uses a metaphor to describe the future state, so it can be remembered easily.
*   The message sincerely communicates my personal convictions (e.g., by voice tone, by sharing feelings)
*   The message describes what I will do personally to support the implementation of Cloud Transformation (e.g., personal behavior changes, organizational systems changes)
*   The message describes specific actions the audience can take to support the change (e.g., attend Cloud Transformation EBAs, Establish Cloud Leadership Team, communicate to others about what is known and what is not known).
*   The message is brief (5 minutes or less).

  

After developing the communication, distribute to other leaders in the organization asking them to personalize and communicate in their organizations.

Every time you deliver your message, ask questions and get the audience involved in a two-way dialogue. This will help the audience become involved in the change effort from the first moment they hear about it from you.
