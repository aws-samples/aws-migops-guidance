**Stakeholder Assessment  
**
-----------------------------

Stakeholder Management is the process by which you identify your key stakeholders and win their support. Stakeholder Assessment or Analysis is the first stage of this, where you identify and start to understand your most important stakeholders. The Stakeholder Assessment identifies and captures information about the people who will be affected by the cloud migration. The analysis is used throughout the cloud migration journey to:

*   Identify people internal and external to the organization who are affected by the change
*   Define and monitor stakeholders' readiness to undertake the cloud migration, as well as the opportunities and challenges in their participation
*   Design support for stakeholders throughout the cloud migration
*   Begin to identify potential champions or advocates
*   Understand the breadth of the impact of the cloud migration on the organization, from a people perspective

The purpose of conducting a stakeholder assessment is to detect the level of acceptance or the general attitude regarding the cloud migration on the part of all relevant stakeholders, as well as the ways they can influence the project.

### **Guidelines**

  
The Stakeholder Analysis is reviewed regularly and updated throughout the Cloud Migration to reflect changes in the project, its impacts, and the needs of its stakeholders. Remember, stakeholders can be both organizations and people, but ultimately you must communicate with people. So, be sure to identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholder organization. General guidelines to consider:

*   Organizational characteristics and culture
*   Regional vs. global segments
*   Centralized vs. decentralized segments
*   Language/translation requirements
*   Consider other initiatives or events being experienced or planned for the key stakeholder group

  

### **Who to involve**

Executive sponsor, Migration Project Leader, Migration Change Leader, Internal Change team liaison and HR.

### **When to use  
**

Initiate your stakeholder assessment process early in the discovery phase of your cloud migration. Consider partnering and participating in migration readiness assessment and planning sessions to get a closer picture at the potential impacts and the audiences affected.

### **Why Do It  
**

Below are but a few of the benefits that can be realized with proper stakeholder management:

*   The most powerful stakeholders can be identified early and their input can then be used to achieve the project's objectives
*   Support from the more powerful stakeholders will help win more resources thus making the project more likely to succeed
*   By communicating with stakeholders early and often, they can fully understand the project benefits and may support the Cloud Migration more actively when necessary
*   By understanding stakeholder expectations, the People & Change team can more effectively anticipate likely reactions and can build into the plan the actions that will be needed to capitalize on positive reactions while avoiding or addressing any negative reactions
*   We can identify conflicting or competing objectives among stakeholders early and develop a strategy to resolve the issues arising from them
*   Can increase employee and stakeholder engagement
*   Help to identify areas to improve communications and feedback with stakeholders
*   Minimize change resistance

  
Furthermore, it helps the People & Change team understand and determine:

*   Who will receive these messages (the target audience)
*   Who will help engage the target audience, word the messages and deliver them. These are likely to be people who understand the target audience well, and are respected by them
*   Who can help to make sure the messages translate into action and remain understood over time. These are likely to be people with the authority to make sure the recommendations are carried out
