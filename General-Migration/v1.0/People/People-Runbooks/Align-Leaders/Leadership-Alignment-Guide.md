The ultimate value of stakeholder and leadership alignment is to align key leaders in understanding a) who will be impacted by Cloud Migration/Transformation; b) how they will be impacted; and c) periodically gauge the readiness of the organization; d) how cloud goals enforce and enable our strategic organizational imperatives. Sample activities include stakeholder management/alignment planning, leadership action planning and participation in key stakeholder updates as needed.

Onboard and prepare key stakeholders and leaders early.   Understand who the key leaders are, understand their transformation goals, and conduct a gap analysis to call out any conflicts in leadership objectives to create leadership alignment toward a unified transformation goal. Determine what is needed to effectively lead their teams through the change.
