**TOOL: Impact assessment**
---------------------------

Once the future state has been designed, it is necessary to understand and capture how significantly different the current state is from the desired future state. Understanding the degree of change is very important to planning how the change will be managed. This document provides describes how to capture impacts related to redesigned processes, new technologies and/or a corporate restructure. This approach can be leveraged for any manage change effort.

### **Guidelines**

*   There are several ways to approach gap analysis. Generally, this can be seen as a two-step process. Both steps can be completed, or the Change Acceleration team can move straight to the stakeholder based gap analysis & impact assessment.
    
*   **Conduct a change area impact assessment.** This assessment looks at the macro effects of the change. Change Acceleration and the Process Design and/or Business Operations Teams should consider the change impact areas (e.g. skills, process, performance management, technology) of the change, and then consider all the potentially impacted stakeholder groups for each change impact area by process function.
    
*   **Conduct a stakeholder-based assessment.** From all the stakeholder groups identified in the change impact assessment, and with the stakeholders identified in the stakeholder identification & analysis, conduct the gap analysis and impact assessment from the perspective of the stakeholder – how will they be impacted, what will their reactions/ responses be.
    

### **Definitions**

*   _**Gap analysis –**_ to understand and document the change (or gap) between the current/future states. For example, the gap may be a significant change from service to sales skills requires. It is also important to document what is staying the same.
    
*   _**Impact assessment**_ – to understand the impact the change will have when it is implemented based on scale, scope and size of the impacts (e.g. employee numbers, business unit, scale, size of impact)
    
*   _**Issues / risks / barriers**_ – to document potential areas of resistance that could prevent the change from being implemented successfully. It is necessary to capture these issues / risks / barriers to be able to plan appropriate change management activities in the change management plan and to be able to execute them effectively. If there are a significant number of risks – they may need to be documented in a separate "change risk" document.
    
*   _**Who is impacted?** –_ to capture the impacted stakeholder groups who will be the change targets / need to undergo a personal transition when the change is executed
    

### **Who to involve**

Executive sponsor, Migration Project Leader, Business Process Design Team, Migration Change Leader, Internal Change team liaison and HR.

### **When to use**

Use whenever a change is impacted the business. Use to map all change impacts that have a medium to high level impact on business end users

  

### **Inputs and Outputs  
**

| Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | --- |
|   *   Business Case      *   Final business process design flows, requirements and documentation      *   Organizational design model – if a restructure is part of the initiative      *   Readiness Assessment results        |   *   Change Impact Analysis      *   Change Impact Finding & Mitigating Recommendations        |

  

### **Instructions**

1.  Partner with business process design team(s) to understand process design approach and methodology
    
2.  Confirm process design milestone, timeline and scope
    
3.  Leverage process design approach to capture change impacts (via workshops, process design documentation, focus groups etc)
    
4.  Confirm process design calendar
    
5.  Establish cadence for capturing initial change impacts (e.g., initial change impact documentation, review and confirmation and executive briefing)

| Impacted Area | Definition/Description of Impact | Current Environment _(what is the current situation?)_ |   Future Environment   _(what's the desired future state?)_   | Change Gap/Impact **_(what major change is required to achieve future state?)_** |   Who is impacted?  _(team/business unit/stakeholder)_   | Level of Impact | Change Issues/Risks/Barriers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _e.g. Leadership, culture, process, policies, structure, skills & capabilities, performance management, systems_    _Complete a separate table for each organizational area / key change_  | _Provides a brief overview of the change_ |   _What's the current state?_   |    _What's the desired future state?_   |   _What are the major changes/ impact between current & future state? What is staying the same? What needs to continue?_   |    _Who are the stakeholders impacted / who are the change targets?_   |   _What is the level of change impact? (Use "Level of Change Impact" sheet or consider high/medium/low)_   |    _What are the key issues or risks that could prevent this change from happening successfully?_   |

### **Levels of Impact**

| Level Rating | Level Impact | Level of Impact Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | No Impact |   Use when there is no impact or very minimal impact.   **Examples**  *   _Customers and Markets: There is no change to customer and markets at all._ *   _Process, Information and Interactions: Very similar to current process_ *   _Technology and Systems: No change or very minor change to technologies, interface, methodologies, data and transactions_   |
| 1 | Fair Impact |   Use when there is some change from the current operational environment.  **Example**  *   _Organization, People and Assets: Some impact but no organizational change is required_   |
| 2 | Moderate Impact |   Use when there is a visible change/impact from the current operational environment.  **Example**  *   _Process, Information and interactions: This business process is impacted and requires revision._   |
| 3 | High Impact |   Use when there is significant change from the current operational environment.  **Example**  *   _Technology and Systems: The existing technology, data and transactions are significantly changed (e.g., Infosys process change is required)_   |
| 4 | Very High Impact |   Use when there is a fundamental change or the introduction of a completely new concept:  **Example**  *   _Organization, People and Assets: There may be new roles/significant changes to existing organizational structure. Changes result in very significant cultural change._   |
