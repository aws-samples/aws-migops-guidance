**Establish Feedback Loop**
---------------------------

The primary objective of this action is to provide vehicles for two-way information sharing, involve key stakeholders throughout the project and collect feedback to monitor communication effectiveness. (Note: this should be incorporated into the plan as part of measurement.) Establishing a feedback loop allows for collecting honest reactions from stakeholders and refinement / continuous improvement of Change Acceleration activities based on actual data.

### **Guidelines**

*   In designing the feedback process, specify time required for people to receive answers to their inquiries or comments
    
*   Consider specific needs of stakeholders
    
*   May need to establish multiple loops (e.g., electronic vs. print) to capture feedback during different phases throughout the project
    
*   Consider timeliness of providing feedback (weekly, monthly, etc.)
    
*   Establish validity of data
    
*   Leverage easy-to-use tool (for team, customer)
    
*   Act of feedback
    
*   Share what you are learning
    
*   Keep it anonymous
    

### **Opportunity areas**

Consider the following areas when seeking feedback on quality of materials and presentations, delivery methods, notification of events, as well as regularity and consistency of the messaging for the initiative.

|   *   Project team performance      *   Leadership alignment activities      *   Leadership and management commitment      *   SMEs and Champion involvement and engagement        |   *   Communications (all vehicles)      *   Awareness and engagement presentations (session evaluations)      *   Training materials (training evaluations)      *   Timing of events        |

### **Feedback mechanisms**

*   1-1 interviews
    
*   Workstream Focus groups
    
*   Department meetings
    
*   Engagement / readiness surveys
    
*   Communication portal
    
*   Project mail box
    

### **Instructions**

1.  Determine media for capturing and sharing feedback
    
2.  Develop feedback process (involve internal change team and HR)
    
3.  Develop feedback tool (Surveys, Evaluations forms, 1-1 interview questionnaires, project mailbox, etcâ€¦)
    
4.  Implement and integrate feedback tool in all change engagement tactics and engagement touch points
    
5.  Document and report feedback
