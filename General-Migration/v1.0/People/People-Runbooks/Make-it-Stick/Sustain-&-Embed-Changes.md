**Sustain & Embed Changes**
---------------------------

### **Purpose  
**

The objective of this activity is to ensure _People_ related items are in place following the cloud migration effort. This document highlights the steps outlined in the sustainability guide.

### **Instructions  
**

1.  Identify ongoing Change Acceleration needs
2.  Transition ongoing ownership
3.  Transition communications
4.  Transition training
5.  Change Acceleration Sign Off
6.  Key Questions for Sustaining the Change

#### **Step 1. Identify ongoing Change Acceleration needs**

At the completion of the Cloud Migration, it is quite likely that changes / case for changes emerged as a result (for example, changing the culture/behavior of one area, may have resulted in a need for process change in another business area). Or potentially, as a result of the success of this cloud migration effort, it should be repeated across other Business Units.  
Below are recommended steps to pursue to determine ownership for future phases of change:

1.  Review your change planning materials and feedback. What key risks have been identified throughout the process that could be addressed with future change projects? What feedback has emerged that you were not expecting? Where do you see natural next steps for the organization?
    
2.  Prioritize the potential future changes. Which ones are essential and which are nice-to-haves? How easy would these future change initiatives be to implement? Which changes might be considered low-hanging fruit? Which changes will have the greatest impact on the organization?
    
3.  Identify future Change Sponsors. Working with your current Change Sponsor or senior Business Leaders, identify the senior executive who has the ability to sponsor a change project and identify the potential business case. In order to get approval to move forward with the new project, a senior business leader must be able to see business value to his/her business unit. Repeat the Change Process from the Define phase for the new change project.
    
4.  For change initiatives, repeat the change framework conducted in this change, starting with project kick-off and assembling your change team.
    

#### **Step 2. Transition ongoing ownership**

Identify Change Acceleration activities that need to be completed / ongoing beyond the life of the Cloud Migration? What formal structures / responsibilities need to be established /assigned to business as usual roles? How do you plan to transition and agree ongoing ownership of the changes?  
For every change project, there have likely to have been a number of stakeholders involved and a number of people executing the change management plan. Identify who should appropriately be involved in the ongoing sustainability of the change project.  
Set timeframes to re-evaluate and review ongoing ownership at intervals after the official completion of the project (e.g. 3 months, 6 months, 12 months – depending on the project duration).

Here are some potential considerations for ensuring the change is embedded and sustainable:

*   Formalize the change measurement through quarterly reporting to the Change Sponsor or other Senior Executive
*   Embed the change into the employee's performance plan or job responsibilities
*   Dedicate a % of the FTEs weekly time to monitoring the change
*   Aligning the change related activities to other formal processes / policies (e.g. annual performance plan, annual compliance training etc)
*   Depending on the project needs, you may need to develop a continuous improvement plan / ongoing review plan to monitor and evaluate your change. Example contents for a Continuous Improvement plan:
    *   Purpose
    *   Governance Structure
    *   Roles & Responsibilities
    *   Calendar of events / review & feedback sessions
    *   Ongoing Measures of Success  
          
        

#### **Step 3. Transition communications**

The objective here is to shift complete management of the communication strategy to the customer organization to ensure that planned communications continue. Key actions to consider:

*   Develop transition plan
    
*   Identify ongoing communication champions
    
*   Meet with communication champions to outline roles, responsibilities, hierarchy and action items
    
*   Conduct transition meeting to confirm next steps
    
*   Develop communication roadmap
    

  
Key considerations to consider:

*   Make sure communication champions are ready to accept the transition – that the team is adequately trained, has the time to accomplish the tasks, and is technologically ready to support the program
    
*   Identify the right client resources to manage ongoing communication at the project's inception
    

#### **Step 4. Transition training**

The objective here is to provide the customer organization with a follow-up training plan and to develop additional materials to address training gaps that were discovered post-cloud migration. In addition, to provide the client with a post-project archive. Key actions to consider:

*   Review feedback, lessons learned and/or changes
    
*   Solicit feedback from the participants via the evaluation form
    
*   Develop additional training support materials as appropriate
    
*   Document a post-cloud migration training plan (i.e., training for new hires, quarterly or event-driven training refreshers, etc.)
    
*   Create a cloud migration archive of all associated training materials (project plan, audit and assessment findings, training strategy, curriculum outlines, finalized documentation, evaluation forms, etc.)
    
*   Develop plan for updates / revisions of materials
    

#### **Step 5. Change Acceleration signoff**

Determine who needs to receive Change Acceleration sign off from, to approve that the Change Acceleration activities are now complete. Organize meetings with Change Sponsor / Business Leaders to discuss:

*   Any new change projects that might have been raised during your project / during the project review session
    
*   Transition of ongoing ownership
    
    *   What their ongoing role regarding the change is
        
    *   Their support required for team members
        
*   Any outstanding items that need to be addressed / followed up before the project can be officially signed off / completed?
    
*   "Sign off" / Approval for project deliverables
    
*   "Sign off" / Approval for the project
    

  
Example Sign-Off Record sheet:

|   **Date**   |   **Document #**   |   **Deliverable**   |   **Author**   |   **Approved By**   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   Insert Date   |   Insert document reference number (if relevant)   |   Title of change related deliverable   (e.g. Communication Strategy & Plan, Change Management Strategy and Plan, Continuous Improvement Plan)   |   People who developed the deliverable   |   Signature of Change Sponsor / Business Leader who needs to approve the deliverable   |

  

#### **Step 6. Key questions for sustaining the change**

The change is integrated into how the customer organization conducts business. Now what?

| KEY STEPS | KEY QUESTIONS FOR SUSTAINING THE CHANGE |
| --- | --- |
| **Identify what has been learned so far in the process** |   *   What worked? What did not work?      *   What have we achieved so far? What have we not achieved?      *   Who, outside our project group, can benefit from our learning on this project?      *   How will we surface key learnings and share them with a wider group to expand change capability?        |
| **Develop a plan to sustain and amplify the change** |   *   What is the plan to transfer learning and knowledge to maintain future accountabilities?      *   How will we keep the momentum going?      *   How will we create, align, and leverage management routines?      *   How will we ensure appropriate learning/feedback mechanisms are in place?      *   What is the plan to further align major systems and processes to sustain the change?        |
| **Acknowledge, communicate and celebrate success and honor influential participants** |   How will we celebrate success and honor influential participants?   |
|   **Identify the role of leadership in sustaining the change**   |   *   What leadership roles (formal and informal) are needed to sustain the change?      *   What is our plan to address the leadership needs to sustain the change?        |
