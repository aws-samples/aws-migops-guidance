**Monitor and manage risk mitigation**
--------------------------------------

The objective of this action is to launch the activities set forth in the **Risk Mitigation Strategy and Plan**. An important goal of Change Acceleration is to work closely with cloud migration team to assess and analyze risks, formulate a solution or mitigation plan, assign ownership and address the risk for closure. The resolution of risks requires commitment and close alignment with executive sponsor and leaders and champions.

  
First time practitioners can leverage the "Monitor and Manager Risk" checklist provided within this document as a reference guide throughout the cloud migration process.
