**Deploy Training Plan**
------------------------

The objective of this action is to launch the activities set forth in the **Training** **Strategy** and plan. Change Acceleration's focus is to quickly assess developmental and training needs, identify training gaps, alignment with existing training practices and delivery of training to support the future state model. It is important to consider executing a training effort that is consistent with what the customer organization normally conducts.

  
First time practitioners can leverage the "Training Plan" checklist provided within this document as a reference guide throughout the cloud migration process.
