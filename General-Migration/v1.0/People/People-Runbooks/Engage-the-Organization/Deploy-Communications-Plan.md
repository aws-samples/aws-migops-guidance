**Deploy Communications Plan**
------------------------------

The objective of this action is to launch the activities set forth in the **Communications Strategy** and plan. The focus is to ensure Change Acceleration alignment with Cloud Migration team activity, alignment with executive sponsor, designated leaders and champions, HR and the internal communications team. It is of critical importance to secure commitment from executive sponsor and leaders throughout the deployment of communication activities to maintain focus on the benefits and business value and sustain overall stakeholder engagement.

  
First time practitioners can leverage the "Deploy Communication Plan" checklist provided within this document as a reference guide throughout the cloud migration.

### **Activities and Assumptions**

This document assumes the Communications strategy and plan is validated and approved by the cloud migration leadership team, the executive sponsor, HR and internal communications team. It also assumes the stakeholder analysis step is complete and the stakeholder matrix is current.

This document focuses on the "Communications" work stream of the Change Management plan. Change Acceleration areas of focus under "communications" include:

*   Communication Setup
    
*   Media Analysis
    
*   Key Messaging
    
*   Communication Development
    
*   Communication Deployment
    
*   Communication Monitoring
    

  
Note that all of the following steps relate to the components of the communications plan. Any plan would include the strategy, goals, audiences, messages, measurements and the tactics (timing, deliverables, budget, responsibilities, media, etc.). In the introduction, explain why the change is necessary and how it fits into the overall business strategy. Describe what is changing for each group, the role technology plays, and any process changes. Create communication planning matrix (i.e., what will be delivered, when, how, to whom, by whom.)
