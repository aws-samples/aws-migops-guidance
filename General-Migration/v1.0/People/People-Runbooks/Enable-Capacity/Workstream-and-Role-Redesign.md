### **General Job Redesign Considerations**

*   **Variety** - Greater variety in a job can improve the interest, challenge and commitment of the role holder to the task. Doing the same repetitive tasks may offer little challenge and can lead to role holders losing interest or becoming and dissatisfied.
    
*   **Responsibility** - Individuals need to feel responsible for the work they are doing, whether individually or as part of a team. Their work should be clearly identified so they can see that they are personally responsible for the outcomes (successes and failures) that occur as a result of their own actions.
    
*   **Autonomy** - This goes hand in hand with responsibility. Autonomy means giving more scope to individuals to regulate and control their own work within the parameters set for the job.
    
*   **Task Identity** - Individuals often receive more satisfaction from doing a 'whole' piece of work. This is more likely to occur when a task or job has a distinct beginning and end which is clearly apparent to the role holder and others who work around them. It is highly desirable that people see the results of the work they have produced, either on their own or as a part of a team.
    
*   **Recognition and Support** - Individuals aspire to have jobs that contribute to self-respect, particularly through acceptance and recognition by fellow workers and their supervisors. Jobs need to encourage sound working relationships between individuals, provide clearly defined areas of responsibility and where possible, support team working.
