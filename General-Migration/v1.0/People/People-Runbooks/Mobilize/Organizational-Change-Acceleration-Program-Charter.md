====================

**People Transformation Framework  
**
--------------------------------------

The People Transformation offering enables customers to achieve business outcomes by helping customers identify and address the impacts that technology transformation has on culture, leadership, talent roles, skills, behaviors, and mindsets. This 52+ week engagement covers the full scope of the CAF People Perspective for Cloud transformation and aims to accelerate AWS platform adoption. There are three phases within this offering: 1) Leadership Mobilization & Organizational Readiness 2) Organizational Enablement and 3) Organizational Sustainability and Adoption.

If you are leveraging this offering as a continuation of the Launch Offering - People & Change Accelerator, please carefully asses the outcomes, as well as the labor/duration of execution, as it is a best practice to treat the Alignment phase of this methodology as iterative and ongoing, given the often rapidly changing circumstances that occur in a transformation effort. If the Launch offering outcomes are still relevant, please adjust the scope/labor/duration of this engagement as appropriate.

*   Change Acceleration Charter
