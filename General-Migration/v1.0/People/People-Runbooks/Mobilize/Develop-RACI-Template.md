**Decision Rights / RACI**
--------------------------

A decision rights, or RACI, template helps gain a common understanding for who makes decisions or performs activities in an initiative or in the future state of an organization. It helps set expectations upfront and minimizes issues that may arise later.

### **Guidelines**

*   If there is disagreement about who is responsible for an activity, it may help to break it down to task-level
    
*   Responsibility for a decision generally means that that person is responsible for getting the decision made - the accountable person is the final decision maker(if there is disagreement about the decision rights, discussing specific examples or relevant scenarios can help provide clarity)
    
*   For any key stakeholders who are consulted, discuss what the consultation should look like, e.g. off-line review of a near-final draft of a document vs. a series of two- hour discussions
    
*   Revisit periodically â€“ expectations of decision rights may change quickly once they begin to be exercised
    

### **Who to involve**

Migration Project Leader, Migration Team Leads, Migration Change Leader, Members of the Readiness Planning team and HR.

### **Definitions**

*   **R = Responsible** to perform the activity / get the decision made
    
*   **A = Accountable** to ensure the activities is performed / make the decision
    
*   **C = Consulted** to provide input
    
*   **I = Informed** of the result / decision
