**Create Training Strategy & plan**
-----------------------------------

The training strategy is a key component of the Change Acceleration process within a Cloud Transformation Program. Training is a key element in preparing your cloud migration team to understand, and perform their jobs, in a cloud transformed future state. It provides the formal structure, instruction, and practice that help users learn and prepare to follow the future state processes and operate the new technology. It also helps them gain a better understanding of the future state through introduction and review, practice, and questions

  
The purpose of the training strategy is to describe what will be done to enable employees impacted by the cloud migration to perform new processes and give them confidence in using Cloud applications through training and performance support..

### **Why**

The training strategy provides the structure and focus for identifying training that needs to be delivered, and the process for developing and delivering the training program. It helps users make the connections between the information they have learned from communications and activities and the way they will work in the future.

### **Who to involve  
**

Migration Project Leader, Migration Change Leader, Training Leader, Members of the Readiness Assessment team, Internal Training Department and HR.

### **When to use it  
**

Training Strategy and Planning efforts start at the beginning of your cloud migration effort. Typically, during the migration assessment phase. During this phase, gaps and change impacts are identified as well as the audiences impacted by the migration.

### **Instructions**

1.  Understand the Training Development Process. In order to create a Training Strategy, first time practitioners need to familiarize themselves with the training development process as outlined below. The process starts with a training needs assessment and direct input from the cloud migration readiness assessment and stakeholder analysis. These instructions will focus on the steps needed to create the training strategy document.
2.  Develop Training Strategy & Plan
    1.  Collect information from the Cloud Migration Readiness Assessment and Stakeholder Analysis
    2.  Conduct interviews with executive project sponsor and project leadership team to get their insights into the customer training needs
    3.  Conduct interviews with internal training teams to understand specific training needs and appropriate training delivery methods
    4.  Conduct interviews with HR to understand potential impacts to future state roles and setting guidelines in how to best partner with them throughout the training process
    5.  Conduct interviews with functional process area leaders to understand specifics for their area or function
    6.  Conduct interviews with outward facing groups, such as sales to understand potential training impacts to customers and suppliers
    7.  Evaluate all documentation and information and follow-up with key stakeholders as needed for additional input
    8.  Build your Training Strategy deck following the structure outlined below:
        1.  Training Objectives
        2.  Training Guiding Principles

The purpose of the Training Needs Assessment is to understand the current training environment and training audience and to begin to uncover key areas where specific attention should be focused during training.

The primary sources of information for the Training Needs Assessment are:
        1.  Stakeholder Assessment
        2.  The Change Readiness Assessment
        3.  AWS Migration Readiness Assessment
        4.  Discussions with the functional team leads
        5.  Discussions with the learning delivery team
    2.  Conduct Interviews:
        1.  Conduct interviews with internal training teams to understand specific training needs and appropriate training delivery methods
        2.  Conduct interviews with HR to understand potential impacts to future state roles and setting guidelines in how to best partner with them throughout the training process
        3.  Conduct interviews with functional process area leaders to understand specifics for their area or function
