**Create Change Acceleration Strategy & plan**
----------------------------------------------

A change acceleration strategy is a plan for how to make something different. It provides a consistent and systematic approach to making adjustments to the application of tools or technologies, processes or skills during a project or initiative. In business, a change management strategy describes specific ways in which an organization will address such things as changes in the way it operates its business, technology, supply chain, organizational structure or project scope. The strategy provides direction and results in informed decision making throughout the cloud migration process.

  
The purpose of the Change Acceleration Strategy is to provide a thoughtful, structured approach to delivering the right change tactics to the right people at the right time throughout the course of the cloud migration.
