**Develop Risk Mitigation strategy & plan**
-------------------------------------------

The objective of the Change Acceleration Risk Mitigation Strategy is to reduce risk and accelerate cloud migration.

### **Why**

  
Establishing a risk mitigation process offers a structured way to have visibility into the People issues related to the cloud migration. It allows for a consistent review of the status of the project as the team moves through the designated phases. This process will ensure the deliverables are on time, on budget and with high quality. It also offers an integrated approach with the cloud migration team to identifying and addressing risks. This process will enable the People & Change team to:

*   Determine schedule for periodically evaluating how the cloud migration is going
    
*   Develop evaluation tool
    
*   Conduct periodic evaluations
    
*   Determine priorities for action and assess risks of not acting on the issues that are identified
    
*   Determine corrective actions for priority items
    
*   Assign ownership for corrective actions
    
*   Monitor progress toward corrective action and re-evaluate regularly
    

  

### **Guidelines**

Collaborate closely with the cloud migration team to define and address risk identification and the mitigation process. Leverage findings from leadership alignment interviews. Establish guidelines for how _People_ related risks assigned to the People & Change team. Set dimensions by which the People & Change will categorize risks. Some examples may include Vision & Clarity, Culture, Commitment, Communications, retention and engagement, Skills and Capability. Participate in weekly status meetings to monitor and review risks and issue logs, decisions and interdependencies.
