**1.0 Creating a Shared Need for Change**
=========================================

Successful change organizations learn to frame the need for change as more than a short-term threat. They work to find ways to frame the need as a threat and opportunity over both the short and long term. By doing so, they begin to get the attention of key stakeholders in a fashion that ensures their involvement beyond what can be gained from a short-term sense of urgency. The key with motivation is to balance Threats and Opportunities to get people moving and pointed in the right direction.

**Threat - If we don't change…**

Threats are reasons for change that focus on letting go of the current state. Threats tend to make the current state no-longer as attractive or even bearable as it once was. Threats tend to deliver the message: “Get moving!”

**Opportunity - if we do change…**

Opportunities are reasons for change that focus on attracting people toward a specific new or future state. Opportunities tend to be future focused, and “growth” oriented. Opportunities deliver the message: “Come over here, or come this way!”

**Short Term**

Short-term motivators will take effect relatively soon or quickly. The definition of short-term can be very subjective and specific to the project or situation. Short-Term motivators tend to communicate a sense of urgency or “We need to act NOW!”.

**Long Term**

Long-term motivators will take effect “later” or sometime in the future. They may build up over time. They tend to provide a sustainable power of motivation.

**2.0 Shaping the Vision**
==========================

An effective vision statement describes the outcome of the change. It is clear, legitimate, widely understood and shared; the vision is shaped in behavioral terms. It is not a flashy slogan; rather it describes what good looks like in the future. It is compelling, measurable and emotionally exciting. It serves as the North Star for all stakeholders who will be a part of/impacted by the change effort.
