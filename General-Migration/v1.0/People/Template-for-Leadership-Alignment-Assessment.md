Interview Setup
===============

There are three main topics that the questions fall into: Understanding of the \[Enter Program Name\] , Issues and change history, and finally, leadership and sponsorship role. Within each of these three main sections there are one to four questions that aim to dive deeper into the main topics.

The questions are asked in an open-ended conversational style in order to get as much information possible from each leader. This will also help in the rating of each question/answer pair. The questions for each topic are rated on a scale of one to five; one being – “needs work” and five being – “no issues.” The rating is based on the response to each question and is optional.
