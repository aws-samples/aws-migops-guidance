**Overview of People and Change**
=================================

**Purpose  
**
--------------

We help our customers accelerate their AWS journey with Culture and Change Leadership strategies. We believe the value realization of cloud is dependent on the degree to which enterprise pays attention to their people - how they lead people through change and bring them along the cloud journey. Leveraging our experience across enterprise organizations, we offer prescriptive guidance based on lessons learned and best practices to help leaders enable their organization's AWS journey.

The leadership, culture, and change perspective is critical to establishing an organization’s cloud fluency and readiness to execute an enterprise-wide transformation effort. The impact of cloud will be felt across the entire organization, and speed and degree of success is strongly connected to the existing culture of the organization. Understanding these cultural implications, the customer’s receptivity to change, prior change successes and failures, organizational communication patterns, organizational structure, degree of executive sponsorship, leadership commitment, organizational impact, and cross-functional alignment are all critical elements of building a successful approach to cloud adoption.

To prepare for an enterprise transformation, the organization must have a critical mass of people with production experience on AWS, established operational processes, and a leadership team dedicated to mobilizing the appropriate resources and leading teams through the many organizational and transformational challenges presented over the course of a large-scale change effort. Based on many years of experience leading and advising enterprises across a wide array of industries, AWS has found that organizational adoption of change and political and cultural impact are the most challenging and underestimated roadblocks to cloud adoption success. 

The People Accelerator offering enables customers to achieve business outcomes by helping customers identify and address the impacts that technology transformation has on culture, leadership, talent roles, skills, behaviors, and mindsets. This 16 week engagement focuses on Leadership Mobilization & Organizational Readiness to accelerate cloud adoption.

To scale People & Change Transformation across the Customer’s organization, this engagement should be followed up with Scale Offering - People & Change Transformation.

**Objectives**
--------------

*   Organizational alignment - establish ongoing partnership between organizational structures, business operations, processes, talent, and culture to enable enterprise rapid adaptation to market conditions, and the ability to capitalize on new opportunities.
    
*   Cloud Acceleration - accelerated adoption to the new ways of working by applying a programmatic change acceleration framework that identifies and minimizes impacts to people, culture, roles, and organization structure when moving from current to future state
    
*   Cloud Fluency – build digital acumen to confidently and effectively leverage cloud to accelerate business outcomes
    
*   Transformational leadership – strengthen leadership capability and mobilize leaders to drive transformational change and enable outcome-focused, cross-functional decision making.
    
*   Workforce transformation – enable talent and modernize roles to attract, develop, and retain a digitally fluent high-performing and adaptable workforce that can autonomously drive key capabilities.
    
*   Organization design – assess organization design for alignment with the new cloud ways of working, and evolve as Customers progress through their transformation journey
    

**Key Milestones  
**

**Risks**
---------

*   Lack of Alignment across Leaders
    
*   Lack of active, visible sponsorship from Leaders
    
*   Unmanageable culture clash between old and new
    
*   Failing to engage at the appropriate level of the organization (top)
    
*   Failing to present as one united team (partner delivery resources, AWS delivery resources, account teams, customer delivery resources, etc.)
    
*   Desired business outcomes not achieved fast enough
    
*   Reduced financial return from Cloud investment
    
*   Potential for business disruption if not operationally ’ready’ for the cloud
    

**Decisions**
-------------

*   Assess the customer's need and willingness for a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).  There are robust resources to assist with standing up a CCoE.  
*   Define survey tool for collecting personal information of staff
    
*   Decide on the degree of integration with the Customer's organization change management process
