**Overview of People and Change**
=================================

**Purpose  
**
--------------

We help our customers accelerate their AWS journey with Culture and Change Leadership strategies. We believe the value realization of cloud is dependent on the degree to which enterprise pays attention to their people - how they lead people through change and bring them along the cloud journey. Leveraging our experience across enterprise organizations, we offer prescriptive guidance based on lessons learned and best practices to help leaders enable their organization's AWS journey.

The leadership, culture, and change perspective is critical to establishing an organization’s cloud fluency and readiness to execute an enterprise-wide transformation effort. The impact of cloud will be felt across the entire organization, and speed and degree of success is strongly connected to the existing culture of the organization. Understanding these cultural implications, the customer’s receptivity to change, prior change successes and failures, organizational communication patterns, organizational structure, degree of executive sponsorship, leadership commitment, organizational impact, and cross-functional alignment are all critical elements of building a successful approach to cloud adoption.

To prepare for an enterprise transformation, the organization must have a critical mass of people with production experience on AWS, established operational processes, and a leadership team dedicated to mobilizing the appropriate resources and leading teams through the many organizational and transformational challenges presented over the course of a large-scale change effort. Based on many years of experience leading and advising enterprises across a wide array of industries, AWS has found that organizational adoption of change and political and cultural impact are the most challenging and underestimated roadblocks to cloud adoption success. 

We have developed a set of guidance and best practices, to address transformation leadership, change adoption, mechanisms for acceleration, and a framework for ensuring that those impacted by the transformation effort, will be well-positioned to adapt when needed. This overall approach can be scaled up or down to fit the needs of the organization at a given point-in-time.

**Objectives**
--------------

*   Design the team responsible for mobilizing critical cloud resources
    
*   Define how an organization builds and executes their cloud strategy (teams designed for how the customer intends to operate in the future)
    
*   Establish a dedicated team with single-threaded ownership and set functional areas of the core team to be managed throughout the migration journey
    
*   Customer core team designed for leading and executing a readiness and migration project
    
*   Educate the customer on the impact to culture and the critical role of transformational leadership
    
*   Institute relevant components of the AWS 6-Point Change Acceleration Framework to minimize business disruption of people-related activities and accelerate the people side of cloud adoption
    
*   Documented readiness communication and organization change management plan(s)
    
*   Enable Cloud Program Leadership team, executives, and middle managers to own, lead, and manage the changes within their organizations
    
*   Minimize the perceived negative impact of implementation and resistance throughout the organization
    
*   Ensure that impacted employees understand their new role and are able and ready to utilize the tools and technology implemented
    
*   Enable the Cloud Program team to execute through supporting high performing teams and governance models
    
*   Design and help implement the optimal supporting organizational structure for a post-Cloud environment
    
*   Promote use of the new processes, systems and related functionality outcomes
    

**Key Milestones  
**
---------------------

*   Mobilization for Cloud

*   Leaders are aligned and actively promoting the Cloud

*   People plans are executed
    

**Risks**
---------

*   Lack of Alignment across Leaders
    
*   Lack of active, visible sponsorship from Leaders
    
*   Unmanageable culture clash between old and new
    
*   Failing to engage at the appropriate level of the organization (top)
    
*   Failing to present as one united team (partner delivery resources, AWS delivery resources, account teams, customer delivery resources, etc.)
    
*   Desired business outcomes not achieved fast enough
    
*   Reduced financial return from Cloud investment
    
*   Potential for business disruption if not operationally ’ready’ for the cloud
    

**Decisions**
-------------

*   Assess the customer's need and willingness for a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).  There are robust resources to assist with standing up a CCoE.  
*   Define survey tool for collecting personal information of staff
    
*   Decide on the degree of integration with the Customer's organization change management process
