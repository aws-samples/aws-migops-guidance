Mission Statement
=================

This Delivery Kit provides guidance on how to deploy, extend and customize the publicly available AWS Landing Zone solution. AWS Landing Zone accelerates customer adoption of the cloud by providing a prescriptive set of instructions for deploying an AWS-recommended foundation of interrelated AWS accounts, networks, and core services. AWS Landing Zone provides prescriptive guidance and best practice templates that a customer can deploy into their initial AWS environment, with confidence that it will grow to meet future business needs including security and regulatory compliance requirements. 

This Delivery kit also accelerates customer adoption of the cloud by providing a prescriptive set of instructions for migration of virtual machines from on-premises virtual environment to VMware on AWS. With VMware Cloud on AWS, you can evacuate data centers, create disaster recovery mechanisms, and accelerate application modernization.

Objectives
==========

*   Establish a Landing Zone that extends the customer's on-prem hosting capability enabling the migration of existing application and development of new applications in AWS.
*   Establish a VMware on AWS environment so that customers can avail the below benefits by migrating their virtual workloads to increase performance and innovation by refactoring applications. The key value proposition is to setup a seamless hybrid environment by using the same VMware tools that was used to manage on-premises workloads.
