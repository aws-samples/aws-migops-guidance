Summary
-------

When the decision is made to migrate applications to a cloud like [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws?int_cid=70134000001CaZ5&src=WWW_us_VMW_0cnHu1FmS2pidRE57WJU) (VMC on AWS), a few things need to happen. First and foremost, insight into your applications and application behavior is critical. One of the perks of migration to a public cloud is that you can choose the optimal location to make sure your end-users benefit. But, without networking insights, this is often overlooked. Below is a checklist of the list of documentation to gather from the client during the discovery and planning phase of a VMC engagement.
