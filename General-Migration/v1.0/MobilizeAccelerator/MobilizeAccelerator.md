Mission Statement
-----------------

The Mobilize engagement is where we build an AWS architecture, migration plan, and mobilize businesses to migrate and/or support ongoing operations. Mobilize takes the information obtained during the Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA) and helps customers build the foundation for a successful migration, from training on AWS technology to helping establish updated security processes and operational systems to take advantage of the AWS cloud.

The Mobilize engagement uses Accelerators to deliver the following outputs/outcomes for customers:

1.  Collect inventory and application data to assess the portfolio and develop decision criteria to create initial migration wave plans.
    
2.  Deploy and validate the landing zone, develop required operating and governance models, and migrate up to 5 applications to the customer production environment.
    
3.  Gain hands-on experience operating in the cloud to build confidence, skills, and competency for the migration and transformation of the organization.
    
4.  Define, implement, scale and automate (where applicable), the customer’s security risk and compliance controls on AWS.
    
5.  Establish the future operating model for cloud and plan, guide and support an efficient progression of the operational model during the migration.
    

These Accelerators generate early alignment, speed-up requirements gathering, and expedite first migrations to compress the overall engagement timeframe.

The Mobilize Accelerator helps customers establish and exercise an agile program to accelerate cloud operational readiness and cloud migrations. This Accelerator supports the set-up of low-cost collaboration and planning mechanisms that implement and automate many activities within the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework. These mechanisms optimize end-user experience for distributed teams and are foundational to execute readiness and migration initiatives. The Mobilize Accelerator builds the foundation that all other workstreams leverage to structure and prioritize work, collaborate and document knowledge, and report progress.

This guide provides a template of activities and a suggested schedule to launch a Mobilize engagement and should be adjusted based on the customer’s desired outcomes and related timelimes.

Through this portal and weekly sprint activities customers will experience more transparency. At project close, the customer retains this Operations Portal that serves as a Knowledge Base containing completed activities, decisions, and runbooks that support ongoing operations.
