Customer Outcomes for Overall Engagement
========================================

The Mobilize engagement is designed to help customers accelerate their achievement of Operational Excellence for their workloads running in AWS, while transforming the way they deliver value to their customers. In many cases, this work will be part of a customer's journey to migrate workloads to AWS, but it is also applicable to customers that want to 1) establish AWS operational capabilities for net-new development, or 2) customers who were forced to move their workloads to AWS without completing the desired operational and transformational steps.

### Sample Migration Outcomes 

*   Migration plan to vacate XYZ Datacenter by 31 Mar 2020 
    
    *   12 month migration plan that includes 3 months of decommission. 
        
    *   Lease Dates: ? 
        
    *   Ensure efficient migration to minimize cost and effort.
