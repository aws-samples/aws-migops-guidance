The Mobilize offering is designed to optimize both onsite and/or remote delivery and ongoing operations for geographically distributed customer teams. ProServe works with customers in advance of an engagement kick-off to discuss and establish the mechanisms below. Whitepapers and templates are very helpful, but some of the most significant challenges our customers face are with communicating and executing their readiness and migration initiatives. To help address these concerns, the Mobilize offering includes a low-cost set of collaboration and planning mechanisms that implement and automate many activities within the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework. These mechanisms optimize end user experience.

### Knowledge Management

The Knowledge Base is implemented as an online tool hosted in the customer’s environment and serves as the single repository for information regarding the customer’s cloud journey. The Knowledge Base pairs individual knowledge with that of other individuals in the organization. Organizational knowledge is the type of asset to which no value can be named. When individuals pool their knowledge within an organization, that knowledge can enable the organization to significantly increase their ability to execute against their mission.  
  
The Knowledge Base is a dynamic resource that all members of IT (and potentially the broader organization) will use to run operations and execute strategic initiatives. The Knowledge Base serves as the single place to collaborate and bring a work product through a governance process to validate customer acceptance. The completed Knowledge Base is intended to be a self-service online library including any and all relevant operational Artifacts and Runbooks. At the completion of the Mobilize engagement, the Knowledge Base will encapsulate all technical and business artifacts developed and can be used as reference and training guidance for existing and new team members. Currently, the delivery kits that are used to seed the Knowledge Base are in Confluence format, and additional formats are targeted for future releases.

### Workflow & Activity Management

Delivery is based on agile principles and uses one week sprints to work through the backlog. No project plans are used. Instead, each workstream has a template backlog from which Consultants should tailor the activities specific for the customer. These backlogs are managed in an online tool to provide tracking against the Sprint Goals and offer full visibility to project teams and Executive Sponsorship even when geographically dispersed. Currently, the delivery kits that are used to seed the Backlog are in Jira format, and additional formats are targeted for future releases.

### IT Governance Decision Catalog

An IT Governance Decision Catalog is an online tool hosted in the customer’s environment to serve as a centralized place to track the customer’s decisions throughout their cloud journey. This mechanism helps facilitate the decision workflow and serves as a historical record. All stakeholders involved in the project have access to this catalog to be able to view final decisions and propose recommendations and/or request decisions. The recommended workflow helps customers manage two-way door decisions and overcome blockers by requiring data and documentation to support decisions.

### Sprint Cadence

One week sprints are recommended, where the sprint cycle starts/ends mid-week with supporting sprint ceremonies (demo, retrospective, sprint planning). A daily stand-up is also held each day to ensure progress, communication, and to clear any blockers. Each week, a Customer Executive Sponsor meeting is held to disposition decisions in the IT Governance Decision Catalog, review the Risk Register and help clear any blockers. Online tools are used for all sprint ceremonies which are executed via remote collaboration tools that allow for participant video, screen sharing, and session recording. With a remote workforce, Governance through this cadence and online systems becomes even more critical. Through these mechanisms, Mobilize enables Governance that is inherently built-in to everyday work activities.

### Video Library

All sprint ceremonies and work stream sessions are recorded. Recordings capture screen sharing and audio, ensuring visibility and knowledge transfer for either existing or new team members. This mechanism removes engagement blockers because meetings can still be held, even without all stakeholders. Absent stakeholders can later watch the meeting and provide inputs asynchronously. Organizations are able to capture the evolution and details of an engagement such that future, new team members are able to view recordings to support training and awareness. The recording library supports a geographically dispersed workforce, as well as a remote workforce, that may need to watch meeting recordings after the fact due to competing priorities or timezone challenges. 

### Persistent Chat

Persistent chat rooms for each workstream where team members can collaborate real-time and this serves as a historical record for others to get caught up. This provides more open lines of communication between customers and consultants. These rooms help keep stakeholders focused on completing their activities and allows for updates throughout the day to unblock others.
