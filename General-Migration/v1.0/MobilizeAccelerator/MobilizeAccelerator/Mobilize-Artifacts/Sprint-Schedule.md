Sprint 1 - Schedule Example (layout option 1)
=============================================

The below sprint schedule is intended as a guide and should be updated to reflect session timings that are agreed with the customer. Daily team stand-ups and daily recurring workstream working sessions for initial sprints are recommended to maximize team productivity.  The sprint schedule should be adapted based on customer stakeholder availability.  Sprint 1 and 2 are generally very meeting intensive as current and operational states/designs for each workstream are defined.  Meeting frequency may then be adapted or reduced as workstreams then begin to focus on implementation.
