Workflow Management: Jira
-------------------------

Jira is the platform being used to plan and manage our activities. This is where the project work streams are entering and updating stories as progress is made. 

At the dashboard level, the most recent Activity Stream is shown. If you are assigned issues, they can be viewed from the top level. Within Jira Board you can find the active Sprints and Backlogs. The issue(s) status (To Do, In Progress, Under Review, and Done).  

All issues on the active board must have an Assignee. This assignee is responsible for completing updates and edits and adding comments and/or attaching files. The status is changed based on the progress being made. This can be done on the Sprint Board or within the issue itself. Issues assigned can be retrieved by using quick filters or by selecting only “My Issues”, which are those assigned to you.

Knowledge Management: Confluence
--------------------------------

Confluence is the home base of knowledge and collaboration artifacts. It hosts all workstream content and associated workshops, artifacts and runbooks. It also includes governance items such as the Sprint Calendar and Team Calendars for team visibility.

As teams work together to draft documents, a template is provided that guides you through the artifacts lifecycle. This allows for the originators to place their artifacts in a “DRAFT, IN-REVIEW, and/or BASELINE” stage. Teams also have the capability to upload pertinent artifacts. Others can edit as necessary. There is versioning history provided as well as the capability to compare current to previous versions and quickly display the changes that were made.
