Workstream Leads
----------------

Workstream (WS) Leads are single-threaded leaders (or in some cases single-threaded with 1 named alternate lead). This person is empowered by the Customer Executive Sponsor to make decisions for the WS and propose recommended decisions to customer leadership (via the Decision Catalog). The WS Leads are required to be dedicated to the Mobilize engagement and available full-time at least 3-5 days per week throughout the entire engagement. The WS Lead is expected to take ownership of the WS including helping to drive Launch Ready Planning (LRP), Weekly Sprint Planning, Being a Buyer at Weekly Sprint Demo, and of course participating at Daily Stand-up, Weekly Retrospective, and Weekly Executive Review (of Decision Catalog and Risk Register). WS Leads are typically those with deep knowledge of the customer's operations and also have a growth mindset. These people are seen as leaders within the organization that will help define strategy and policy for initial cloud operational readiness and beyond.
