The AWS Professional Services (ProServe) Team will require access to the customer environment to utilize various collaboration tools during the engagement. The activities that must occur to access to a customer's environment will vary by customer and will be based on their security and onboarding protocols. The below checklist is intended as a guide only and should be adapted based on the customer. Keeping an accurate record of customer onboarding will aid the smooth and methodical initiation of the project.
