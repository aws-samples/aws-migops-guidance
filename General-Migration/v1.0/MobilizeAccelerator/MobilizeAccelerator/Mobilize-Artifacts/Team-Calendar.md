The team calendar is the central location for members of a team to view the Sprint Plan and shared team calendar. Team members must review and update the team calendar regularly ensuring that their schedule is current.

Please notate any company-wide holidays, change-freeze dates, or quarter endings that may affect the entire team. For individual schedules, a recommended color coded guide is found below.Â 

**Recommended Color Coding:**

*   Out of office/Vacation - Blue
*   Remote - Yellow
    
*   Training - Green
