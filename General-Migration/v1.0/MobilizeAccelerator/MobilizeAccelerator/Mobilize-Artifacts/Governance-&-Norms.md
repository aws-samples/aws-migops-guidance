Team Essentials
===============

*   **Attendance:**
    
    *   Team Members are expected to be available to this effort for 3 to 4 days (4-8 hours each day) per week to account for schedule variations. 
        
    *   Team Members take ownership within their Workstream owning and updating tasks in Jira, completing artifacts and preparing for Sprint Demos and Retrospective each week.
        
    *   When you're in the building please attend scheduled working sessions in person. Remote participation is reserved for geographically dispersed team members. This includes all ceremonies (e.g. Daily, Planning, Review, Retro). 
        
*   **Quorum:**  At least one Customer Workstream Lead should be present in order to have a quorum. If not, the session must be rescheduled. 
    
*   **Quality Control:** We're all responsible for our own work and insist on the highest standards. If you believe you need a peer review, please take a bias for action and request a team member to review your work.
    
*   **Recordings:** All sprint ceremonies and work stream sessions will be recorded. Reference the runbook for instructions.
    
*   **Facilitate to Outcomes:** All Team Members take ownership for achieving outcomes. 
    
    *   During workshops, Team Members should be fully engaged (e.g. laptops closed and sidebar conversations outside the room).
        
    *   At the start of a session, restate the purpose/outcomes and utilize a parking lot if needed.
        
    *   JIRA tickets that relate to an internal customer ticketing process should notate or link to the customer ticket.
        
*   **Workstream Working Sessions:** Sessions required for the next sprint must be documented on the Sprint Schedule by 1pm ET each Thursday.  Session invites will then be distributed.
    
*   **Decision Catalog Items:** Decisions must be in "under review" by COB each Tuesday in order to for Leadership to review during the Wednesday Weekly Status Review.
    
*   Weekly Executive Meeting: Friday. Topics: Decision Workflow in JIRA, Risk Register, Recommendations, Blockers
    
*   Daily SCRUM Stand-up: 09:45 - 10:00 AM (Mon-Thu)
    

Reporting Essentials
====================

Prior to the end of each Sprint, WS Leads must complete the following;

1.  Update **‘Accomplishments for current sprint’** on confluence
    
2.  Update **‘Goals for next sprint’** on confluence
    
3.  Review and update **‘Decisions Catalog’** on jira (all ‘Under Review’ decisions are presented to Executive Sponsor for approval as part of weekly reporting)
    
4.  Review jira **‘Active Sprint’** to ensure all workstream stories are accurate in status, content and assignee
    
5.  Review jira **‘Backlog’** and drag relevant stories into next sprint (make sure that each has an assignee and a story point estimate)
    
6.  Update Mobilize Program **‘feedback form’** with suggested additions/edits/enhancements
    

Artifact Governance
===================

*   Artifact pages in Confluence must have the Document Lifecycle Status bar at the top of the page:  
    Team members are responsible for updating the Document Lifecycle Status.
    
*   An artifact in "Baseline" status is ready for promotion to the Knowledge Base.
    
*   All Design Documents must also have a corresponding IT Governance Decision entered for approval. (e.g. AWS Regions, Number and Usage of AWS Accounts, Config Rules, Permissions, etc.)
    
*   Prior to promoting an artifact to the Knowledge Base, it must first be:
    
    *   Baselined - Reviewed and agreed upon by quorum of Workstream membership
        
    *   Baseline artifacts must be shared during the Workstream Demo to ensure visibility
        
    *   Approved for Knowledge Base by Leadership Team
        

Story Point Estimation
======================

1.  **Effort.** How much work is required to complete this task? 
    
2.  **Complexity.** How difficult or complicated is this task? 
    
3.  **Uncertainty.** Do we know exactly what must be done to accomplish this task, or will we need to learn as we go?
    

The combination of these three factors is the story’s _size_. 

|   **Story Points**   |   **Guideline using the modified Fibonacci series**   |   **Notes**   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   1   |   An hour or less   |   Example: “1 story point = 1 person-hour”   |
|   2   |   A couple of hours   |         |
|   **3**   |   **Approximately 1/2 person-day or less**   |   **Tshirt size = Small (3 points)**   |
|   5   |   The better part of a person-day; you may be able to squeeze in a few other small things   |         |
|   **8**   |   **Between one and two person-days**   |   **Tshirt size = Medium (8 points)**   |
|   **13**   |   **More than two days but less than a week**   |   **Tshirt size = Large (13 points)**   |
|   34   |   Approximately one person-week   |   Example: “34 story points = a person-week”   |
|   55   |   More than one person-week   |   Too big - split it into multiple stories   |
