|   This playbook provides an outline and specific instructions to initialize the Customer Operations Portal and import the relevant Mobilize Delivery Kits.    |
| Pre-conditions |
|   All pre-conditions must be met before starting steps in the playbook:  *   Customer has Jira and Confluence accounts and licenses for Mobilize participants.  *   Customer has installed the necessary plug-ins (e.g. Draw.io for Confluence is required.

| Steps |
|   **Import the Delivery Kits**   1.  Provide the customer the "Content" files of the relevant Mobilize Delivery Kits. These .zip files contain the Confluence content in addition to backlogs and other data, but for this step, only the "Content" file is needed. Follow instructions below.      1.  AWS Engagement Manager, Navigate to [AWS Internal Delivery Kit Downloads Site](https://wiki.doleancloud.com/confluence/display/DKD)      2.  Download the .zip files for the Delivery Kits needed.      3.  Open the DK Folder and navigate to DK-Workstream > Content > DK-Workstream\_date\_2020     4.  Send the customer the content file DK-Workstream\_date\_2020 (This can be shared through Chime or Slack)      5.  Import the .zip file into the customer's Confluence          1.  Follow [Atlassian guidance for importing a space](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/import-a-space-from-confluence-cloud-967876449.html)              1.  In Confluence Server, go to  >                  **General Configuration**\> **Backup & Restore**.              2.  Scroll down to **Restore Confluence Data** and select your export file.              3.  Choose **Import**.       6.  Repeat "e" for each of the Mobilize Delivery Kits.      7.  Move all of the Mobilize Delivery Kits underneath the "Mobilize Accelerator" space that was imported.      8.  Ensure all Delivery Kits have been moved, then move or remove any remaining pages within the customer's "Space Directory". All Professional Services content should reside under the "Mobilize Accelerator" Transformation and Operations Portal.   **Tailor to the Customer**   1.  Make updates to the left-hand navigation to improve customer experience.  2.  Update the DK-MobilizeAccelerator Home Page:     1.  Include the Customer's logo     2.
