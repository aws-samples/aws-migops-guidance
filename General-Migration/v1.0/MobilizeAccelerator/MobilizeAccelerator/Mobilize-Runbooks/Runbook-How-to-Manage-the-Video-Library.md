|   Description/Scope     |
| --- |
|   The Video Library stores a catalog of recorded sessions for archival purposes and for end-users to review, educate, and share knowledge. AWS has a serverless application that can be used as a lower cost alternative to using Confluence as described below.    |
| Pre-conditions |
|   All pre-conditions must be met before starting steps in the migration runbook:  *   Before you begin: You must have a separate Recording Space (shown as "Recordings Home" in below images) in Confluence. The Confluence Administrator will need to open permissions for team members to upload large files.    |
| Steps |
|   **Create Video Library in Confluence**  *   Capture Recordings using Chime. Click      **More** and select      **Record Meeting**      from the dropdown. Your attendees will here a message stating "This meeting is being recorded". Check your customer's recording policy, some may request that you also verbally announce that the meeting is being recorded and anyone who doesn't want to be recorded can excuse themselves from the meeting.              ![](/.attachments/DK-MobilizeAccelerator/ChimeRecord.png)       *   Create a new page in your Confluence Initiative and title it      **Video Library.** Set an organization system that makes sense for your initiative. For projects using an agile methodology, organizing by Sprint makes it easy for end-users to find desired content.   ![](/.attachments/DK-MobilizeAccelerator/image2019-3-13_20-29-1.png)  *   As recordings are captured they will be available in the Chime application.      **NOTE**: Recordings are stored in the Chime Application of the user who initiated the recording. *   Download relevant recordings and save them using a naming convention that maps to the agile project organization (e.g. 8.8.18\_Standup or 10.22.18\_LandingZoneDeepDive)              ![](/.attachments/DK-MobilizeAccelerator/DownloadRecording.png)      *   Upload saved recording to the separate Recordings Space in Confluence (see Pre-Condition above).              ![](/.attachments/DK-MobilizeAccelerator/image2019-3-13_20-32-22.png)      *   Link the uploaded recording to the      **Video Library**      page created in bullet 2 above:     *   In the separate Video Space in Confluence, Copy the address of the recording.   ![](/.attachments/DK-MobilizeAccelerator/image2019-3-13_20-36-53.png)  *   *   Navigate to the          **Video Library**          page and select          **Edit.** Highlight the text of the session and click the          link then paste the recording link.   ![](/.attachments/DK-MobilizeAccelerator/image2019-3-13_20-42-1.png)    |
