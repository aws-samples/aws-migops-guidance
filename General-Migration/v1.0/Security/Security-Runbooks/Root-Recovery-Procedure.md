**Purpose**
-----------

This document describes steps to take to regain access to AWS Accounts' Root user if Root password or MFA are no longer available.

**Procedure**
-------------

1.  If Root MFA device is lost or MFA device stopped working, \[Customer\] can use alternative factors of authentication to log into the account as described in 
    [this document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_lost-or-broken.html). In case of any issues with the described procedure, \[Customer\] can contact AWS Customer Service directly or fill up this online 
    [form](https://aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-mfa-support) 
    to regain access to the account.
2.  If Root user password is lost, \[Customer\] can use AWS Management Console to reset the password as described in this 
    [document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys_retrieve.html#reset-root-password).
3.  AWS Customer Service team can also be contacted in regard to any account access related issues. AWS Customer Service team member may be required to validate your identity by verifying Security Challenge Questions configured in the account.
