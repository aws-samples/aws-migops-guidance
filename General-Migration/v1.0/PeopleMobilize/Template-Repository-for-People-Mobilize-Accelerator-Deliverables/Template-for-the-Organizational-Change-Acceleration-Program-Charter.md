*   Leadership Alignment & Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE) Functional Optimization
    
*   Cloud Learning Skills Assessment (AWS Learning Needs Analysis)
    
*   Organizational Readiness Assessment
    
*   Change Impacts
    
*   Case for Change
    
*   Chance Acceleration Strategy Recommendations
    

Deliverable Descriptions
------------------------

Below is the list of descriptions of the deliverables for this workstream:

*   Organizational Change Acceleration Program Charter
    
    *   This provides an overview of workstream scope, resources, deliverable descriptions for alignment at the start of the project/program
        
*   Leadership Alignment Assessment/ Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE) Functional Optimization
    
*   *   This provides an assessment of the disposition and alignment of key leaders in the organization and an initial look at AWS Best Practices to organize and optimize a CCOE over time
        
*   Cloud Skills Assessment (e.g., AWS Learning Needs Analysis (LNA) Report
    *   The LNA is a self-assessment survey that identifies AWS skill gaps and recommends organizational and individual training plans to address these gaps. The result is faster AWS skills acquisition and optimization/prioritization of learning recommendations, and associated budgetary requirements for continued growth. 
    *   **Note:** The LNA is normally conducted by AWS Training & Certification (T&C) team, and the results are shared with the P&C workstream lead and presented to the customer jointly. In the event that the T&C team is unable to conduct the LNA, the P&C Workstream Lead will work to get the LNA set up and the T&C team involved.
*   Cloud Role and Ramp Up Guides
    
    *   From the LNA, insights are gathered to determine what courses are needed for specific role and certifications that are desired and/or necessary for the changes to their role. There are generic cloud ramp up plans by role and solutions available that will be leveraged. Working with the leaders of the impacted stakeholders, cloud courses are determined and align to roles, and custom ramp-up guides by role for each customer are created (if necessary). 
        
*   Organizational Change Readiness Assessment
    
    *   The primary objective in conducting an organization readiness assessment is to understand the organization’s propensity, ability, and desire to adapt to change
        
*   Initial Change Impact Assessment
    
    *   As the future state in the Cloud becomes clearer, it is necessary to understand and capture how significantly different the current state is from the desired future state
        
*   Case for Change
    
    *   Cloud Transformation must be tied to a strong business case, and you will need to communicate the vision in a way that generates commitment from Stakeholders
        
*   Organizational Change Management Strategy and Plan
    
    *   The purpose of the Change Strategy is to provide a thoughtful, structured approach to delivering the right change tactics to the right people at the right time throughout the course of the cloud migration
