Mission Statement
=================

The objective of the People Mobilize Accelerator is to accelerate leadership enablement, cloud leadership functionality, and cloud adoption by mobilizing critical resources to remove non-technical blockers and drive implementation. This approach is based on our belief that value realization of cloud occurs when leaders intentionally focus on organizational alignment, people ability, leadership capability, and culture. Success is dependent upon the degree to which leaders pay attention to their people and how they bring them along on the cloud journey right from the start.

The People Mobilize Accelerator covers key assessments such as: Leadership Alignment, Organizational Readiness, and Change Impact culminating into the Change Acceleration Strategy at the end of the engagement.

**Note: The People Mobilize Accelerator offering (including the Delivery Kit) is to be used in tandem with the Mobilize for AWS Cloud offering, only.**
