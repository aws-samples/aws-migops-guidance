**Organizational Change Acceleration Program Charter**
======================================================

Establishing a formal charter document for each program workstream is important to ensure leadership alignment and buy-in to the initial change management scope of work. A charter document establishes the core of what the change management program team will deliver as well as dependencies the program team has on other areas and/or key stakeholders critical to the success of the change initiative. The purpose of developing a program/project specific organization change acceleration charter is to provide a thoughtful, structured approach to delivering the right change management solutions and tactics based on what is known at the time the charter is completed.

Guidelines
----------

Early in the program start-up phase or planning phase, coordinate and gather the following information from groups such as:

*   Program/project leadership – confirm program scope and timeline
*   Input will serve to establish critical milestones, scope of effort, major events, key stakeholder meetings (steering committees)
*   Services Providers – assess how internal service providers such as corporate communications, training and/or human resources will support the program and specifically the change management team. Input will serve to confirm internal resources required and/or available to support the change effort
*   Internal Change Management – if the client has an internal change management (People & Change) team, then assess how they will support the dedicated OCM project team. Input will serve to confirm internal People & Change resources that will support change effort
*   Workstream leads – interview each workstream lead to confirm scope and timing of critical deliverable and/or events
*   Input will serve to confirm change management support required at the workstream/sub-project level

Who to Involve
--------------

*   Executive Sponsors
*   Project/Program Leader
*   Change Leader
*   Internal services providers (e.g., Communications, Training/Learning and Human Resources), if supporting the cloud change initiative

Why Do It
---------

A formal charter document for the change management program will:

*   Clarify scope and People workstream approach for the specific project/program effort
*   Confirm project/program leadership understanding of the initial end to end change acceleration scope of work, dependencies and key deliverables
*   Outline formal review process for key deliverables
*   Establish a RACI that identified key stakeholders that are or need to be (responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) related to major change acceleration activities or deliverables
*   Defines initial change acceleration metrics and reporting required

When to Use
-----------

Use the charter document to confirm scope, approach and see formal sign off from key executive sponsor. Leverage charter as a guide and discussion document to manage scope and develop specific deliverables as listed within the charter.

Definitions
-----------
