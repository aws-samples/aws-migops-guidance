Change Impact Assessment/Analysis
=================================

Once the future state has been designed, it is necessary to understand and capture how significantly different the current state is from the desired future state. Understanding the degree of change is very important to planning how the change will be managed. This document provides describes how to capture impacts related to redesigned processes, new technologies and/or a corporate restructure. This approach can be leveraged for any manage change effort.

Guidelines
----------

*   **Conduct a change area impact assessment.** This assessment looks at the macro effects of the change. Change Management and the Process Design and/or Business Operations Teams should consider the change impact areas (e.g. skills, process, performance management, technology) of the change, and then consider all the potentially impacted stakeholder groups for each change impact area by process function.
    

Definitions
-----------

*   _**Gap analysis –**_ to understand and document the change (or gap) between the current/future states. For example, the gap may be a significant change from service to sales skills requires. It is also important to document what is staying the same.
    
*   _**Impact assessment**_ – to understand the impact the change will have when it is implemented based on scale, scope and size of the impacts (e.g. employee numbers, business unit, scale, size of impact)
    
*   _**Issues / risks / barriers**_ – to document potential areas of resistance that could prevent the change from being implemented successfully. It is necessary to capture these issues / risks / barriers to be able to plan appropriate change management activities in the change management plan and to be able to execute them effectively. If there are a significant number of risks – they may need to be documented in a separate "change risk" document.
    
*   _**Who is impacted?** –_ to capture the impacted stakeholder groups who will be the change targets / need to undergo a personal transition when the change is executed

| INPUTS | OUTPUTS |
| --- | --- |
|   *   Business Case *   Final business process design flows, requirements and documentation  *   Organizational design model - if a restructure is part of the initiative *   Org. Readiness Assessment results    |   *   Change Impact Assessment/Analysis *   Change Impact findings and mitigating recommendations    |

Instructions
------------

1.  Partner with business process design team(s) to understand process design approach and methodology 
2.  Confirm process design milestone, timeline and scope
3.  Leverage process design approach to capture change impacts (via workshops, process design documentation, focus groups, etc.)
