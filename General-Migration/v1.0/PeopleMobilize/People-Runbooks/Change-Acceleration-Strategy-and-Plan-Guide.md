**Change Acceleration Strategy and Plan Creation**
==================================================

A change acceleration strategy is a plan for how to make something different. It provides a consistent and systematic approach to making adjustments to the application of tools or technologies, processes or skills during a project or initiative. In business, a change management strategy describes specific ways in which an organization will address such things as changes in the way it operates its business, technology, supply chain, organizational structure or project scope. The strategy provides direction and results in informed decision making throughout the cloud migration process.Â The purpose is to provide a thoughtful, structured approach to delivering the right change tactics to the right people at the right time throughout the course of the cloud migration.

Guideline
---------

A well-formulated strategy brings the project or change to life, describing who and how it will impact the organization. To effectively institute a change management strategy, stakeholders must create a plan for how to recognize when a change is needed, how to approve changes, how to implement changes and how to monitor changes to ensure they have brought about the desired effect. The change strategy must be aligned with the Cloud Migration strategic vision and the business case. Interviews with key leaders, impacted stakeholders and participation in early planning and assessment sessions is required. Change Management is a process that requires a high level of integration between a number of partners. This strategy and the subsequent plans require that an effective partnership be developed and maintained between Human Resources, the Cloud Migration Team, Executive Sponsors, Leadership and external vendors/ partners.
