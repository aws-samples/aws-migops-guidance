**Case for Change**
-------------------

Developing a case for Change helps the organization's leadership clarify the need for change and develop a clear, compelling message for change.  
It is not always necessary to conduct a formal Return on Investment (ROI) analysis. Although it is important to operationally define success.

Developing the Case for Change helps you to:

*   Develop a clear description of the desired state with Cloud Transformation
    
*   Assess the impact of closing the gap between the current and future states
    
*   Assess the impact of not closing the gaps
    
*   Create an operational definition of success that is objective and measurable
    
*   Develop a compelling message that inspires and motivates Stakeholders to embrace and implement the change
    

Guideline (What Do I Need?)
---------------------------

*   Recognition from the senior-most leaders of the organization that a need for change exists based on current and expected business results
    
*   A multilevel and cross-functional team charged with identifying and defining the benefits of Cloud Transformation
    

Who to Involve
--------------

Executive sponsor and program level sponsor

Why Do It?
----------

As a leader, you need to effect changes that will enable your organization to succeed in current and future markets. Cloud Transformation must be tied to a strong business case, and you will need to communicate the vision in a way that generates commitment from Stakeholders. People will be resistant to change if they do not believe in what you are asking them to achieve. There is a big difference in performance between someone who "wants" to change and someone who changes because they "have to". A solid and well-communicated Case for Change goes a long way toward getting people to commit to the Cloud Transformation journey because they want to.
