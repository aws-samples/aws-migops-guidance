========

This first stage of assessment focuses on the initial steps of obtaining and analyzing data at the Portfolio Level. The main objective is to identify business drivers and collect general data from applications and infrastructure in order to obtain an initial view of the portfolio, including high-level technical and business attributes such as application names, environment, product versions, criticality, performance values, and others. This is key in order to understand the scope of the project, identify initial migration candidates, and inform the business case.
