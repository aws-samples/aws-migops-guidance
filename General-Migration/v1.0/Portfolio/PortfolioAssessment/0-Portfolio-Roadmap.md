Overview
--------

The roadmap below outlines the typical Portfolio Assessment activities and is divided in four progressive modules. The Portfolio Discovery and Initial planning, and Prioritized Applications Assessment modules have been designed in a way that permits performing these activities during either the Assess or Mobilize phases, or a combination of both. If these modules are performed in the Assess phase, their output will help to accelerate the Mobilize Platform and Migration workstreams as well as the Portfolio workstream to keep iterating the Portfolio Analysis during the Portfolio Analysis and Migration Planning module. The last stage, Continuous Assessment and Improvement, is intended for post-Mobilize (i.e., Migrate/Modernize phase) in order to facilitate detailed wave assessment when migrating/modernizing at scale, and to assess groups of workloads for further optimization.

**Note:** The timeline is indicative and requires adjustments depending on the program circumstances, journey map, and outcomes. The diagram below can be edited with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

Activities

| **Phase** | **Module** |   **Section**   |   **Objectives**   |   **Activities**   |   **Roles**   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Assess and/or Mobilize**        |   **Portfolio Discovery** **and Initial Planning**                      |   **Pre-Requisites (e.g., 2 to 3 weeks before Portfolio Discovery Party)**        |   Assess sources of data, define Discovery Tooling and position it for approval and procurement (if required)  Identify key stakeholders for Portfolio Discovery Party.   |   *   Discuss application and infrastructure data sources (e.g., existing tooling, documentation, CMDB), evaluate the level of confidence in the data provided *   Evaluate/Propose Discovery Tooling (based on gap analysis) *   Assess environment/infrastructure requirements for tooling deployment *   Identify Portfolio Discovery Party Attendees  **Note:** when discussing existing tooling it is possible that a discovery tool will be already in place (i.e., AWS Migration Evaluator, ADS, or third-party tooling). Assess tooling suitability considering **Data Collection Requirements (all stages)**and long-term discovery needs.   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)  Solutions Architect  Account Manager   |
| Activity Planning | Preparing for the party (activities and logistics for the portfolio discovery party) |   Customize delivery kit and portfolio roadmap as needed.  Confirm resources and participation   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)   |
|   **Portfolio Discovery Party**   |   *   Identify business drivers and addressable application scope *   Discuss data requirements *   Establish Application Prioritization Criteria *   Implement discovery tooling (if required)   |   *   Document high-level business drivers and guiding principles *   Review addressable migration scope (this is key to understand the target systems for discovery) *   Socialize/review Data requirements for analysis *   Socialize default Application Prioritization Criteria *   Install & configure discovery tooling (if required), and start data collection   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)Solutions Architect  Account Manager   |
| Post-Party follow-up | Close activities not completed during the party |     |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)   |
| Manual Discovery | Manually assess infrastructure where discovery tooling is either not available or does not support a target system (e.g., legacy systems, restricted systems) |   *   Ad-hoc workshops *   Interviews *   Online questionnaires   | Migration Consultant (portfolio lead) |
| Application Metadata | Gather Application Metadata for Prioritization |   *   Update information   | Migration Consultant (portfolio lead) |
| Preliminary Portfolio Analysis |   *   Obtain initial application and infrastructure inventory *   Identify candidates for Wave 1 (or pilot applications) *   Directional Business Case    |   *   Review Discovery Tooling and/or Data Sources output (Assets and Dependencies) *   Obtain Directional Business Case *   Identify Candidates for Wave 1   |   Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)        |
| **Prioritized Applications Assessment** | **Application Assessment Party** | Detailed assessment (deep dive) of a subset of applications (e.g., wave 1 or pilot apps), produce an AWS design and establish a migration strategy. The process will surface additional requirements and address blockers to enable the desired migration outcomes. |   *   Application(s) Deep Dive *   Initial AWS Design (including initial rightsizing and estimated run cost) *   Migration Strategy   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)  Cloud Infrastructure Architect  Application Architect  Solutions Architect   |
| Post-Party follow-up | Close activities not completed during the party |   *   Close open items   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)   |
| **Mobilize**          | **Portfolio Analysis and Migration Planning**          | Activity Planning |   Preparing for the Portfolio Analysis Party   |   *   Confirm stakeholders/participants *   Confirm data requirements   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)   |
| **Portfolio Analysis Party** | Analysis of the entire portfolio of applications and migration wave planning |   *   Asset and Dependency Discovery Data Output overview *   Review Application Metadata (app to infra mapping, high-level application attributes) *   Iterate 7R Disposition Tree *   Iterate Application Prioritization Criteria *   Draft a migration wave plan    |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)   |
| Post-Party follow-up | Close activities not completed during the party |   *   Close open items *   Handover initial designs to Migration workstream   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)   |
| **Iterate and Baseline Portfolio Assessment Activities** |   Iterate all activities started during Portfolio Parties to enrich existent data, baseline application portfolio, prioritization criteria and 7R disposition tree.  Baselined migration wave plan.   |   *   Iterate and baseline Application Prioritization Criteria *   Iterate and baseline 7R decision tree *   Iterate and baseline dependency groups *   Iterate and baseline Wave Plan   |   Engagement Manager  Migration Consultant (portfolio lead)  Cloud Infrastructure Architect   |
| **Migrate/Modernize** | **Continuous Assessment and Improvement** | **Application Assessment Party (per wave)** | Detailed assessment (deep dive) of a migration wave.
