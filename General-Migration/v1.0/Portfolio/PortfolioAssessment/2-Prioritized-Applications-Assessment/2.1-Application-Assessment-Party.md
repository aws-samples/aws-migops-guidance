Context
=======

  
The Application Assessment Party is a 1- to 3-day sprint-based, interactive event designed to assist the customer with prioritizing a subset of applications targeted for migration and performing a detailed discovery, conducting an AWS design session, and a draft migration strategy. The Party facilitates the identification of specific requirements and blockers for detailed application assessment, application design and migration strategy for the in-scope applications, and resolves them. The duration of the party is dependent on the number of applications to be assessed and its complexity. The base estimate is of 1 day per application; the recommendations is to work with a maximum of 3 applications per party for a maximum of 3-day duration. However, this can change based on application complexity and customer needs.

The Application Assessment Party primary goals are:

*   Validate or Identify a scope of prioritized applications (this could include assisting the customer to develop a prioritization criteria to identify those applications, see use cases below)
*   Dive Deep current architecture, functional and non-functional requirements
*   Create an initial AWS Design for the application outlining requirements and target architecture, including an AWS Run Cost estimate
*   Identify a suitable migration strategy and migration patterns/tooling
*   Identify cases where a given architecture and migration strategy can be re-used by other applications.

Use Cases
=========

*   Stand-alone Party
*   Performed as a continuation of a set of Portfolio Parties (in this case, the output of the Portfolio Discovery Party will include a subset of applications identified)
*   Mobilize Engagement (to dive deep into the Wave 1 or Pilot applications details)
*   As a continuous assessment mechanism for migration/modernization at scale (post-Mobilize phase). This use case focuses the party on assessing migration waves in sequence.

Pre-Requisites
==============

*   Identify and confirm stakeholders and attendees
*   Identify pre-existing sources of data (documentation, diagrams, discovery tooling, inventories, dependency data) and ensure they are available for the Party
*   Validate/Update **Artifact - 7R Disposition Tree** 

Checklist
---------

- 

Expectation setting with the customer executive/leader for the event 

- 

Review tactical and strategic goals of the event, discuss expected friction points

- 

Establish the logistics to escalate to the customer executive if it is needed during the party itself.

- 

Confirm attendees from the customer who will represent roles and responsibilities listed in attendees (see agenda). These attendees should be a mix of doers and decision makers

- 

Preview expectations with the attending leaders of each domain (security, applications, etc.)

- 

Document assigned roles and expected attendees by session / tracks

- 

Confirm logistics for the meeting (single meeting room for all participants or preferred customer tool for virtual collaboration)

- 

Confirm pre-requisites are met

Activity Details
----------------

| Day | Session | Details / Guidance  | Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Day 1** | Goal setting and Business Outcomes | Establish the Goals for the day and document high-level Business drivers and customer outcomes (e.g., cost reduction, transformation, etc.) |         |
| Validated Application Prioritization Criteria (Optional, see Note) |   **Note:** if this party is being performed after **1-Portfolio Discovery and Initial Planning** an application prioritization criteria is likely to be already established. Use this session to iterate/validate the established criteria if needed. The goal of this session is to establish which key attributes will determine the selection of applications for the Party. In some cases, tit will be known, in advance, which applications are being targeted. In other cases, it will be required to choose the most appropriate applications.  The objective is to assist the customer to identify key application attributes to determine priority. This includes assigning a corresponding weighting to the possible values of those attributes. Next, define the attribute importance level for prioritization.  The result will be a ranking of applications. If the weighting/criticality is correct, the top 5 should be good initial candidates for assessment. If the top applications do not make sense, adjust the criteria as needed.   | **Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory****Artifact - Application Prioritization Criteria** |
| Application Deep Dive |   Use the suggested artifacts to conduct a detailed assessment. Ensure the necessary stakeholders to dive deep into the business, architecture, and technology aspects are part of the session.  The use of Discovery Tools for Dependency analysis is highly recommended.   |   Discovery Tool of choice  **Artifact - Prioritized Applications (wave 1 or pilots)****Template - Application Discovery Questionnaire****Template - AMS Application Design Questionnaire** |
| AWS Application Architecture Design | Use the suggested artifacts to elaborate a target design. Consider reusing existing architectural patterns if possible. | **Template - Application AWS Architecture Design and Migration Strategy** |
| Migration Strategy and Patterns | Use the suggested artifacts to establish a migration strategy and approach, including specific technology patterns and migration tooling. | **Template - Application AWS Architecture Design and Migration Strategy****Artifact - 7R Disposition Tree** |
| Wrap-up Day 1 | Review outcomes of the day and next steps |     |
| **Day 2** | TBC | Repeat Deep Dive, AWS Design, and Migration Strategy sessions as needed, depending the number of apps in scope |     |
| **Day 3** | TBC | Repeat Deep Dive, AWS Design, and Migration Strategy sessions as needed, depending the number of apps in scope |     |

Primary Outcomes
================

1.  Application Detailed Discovery
2.  AWS Application Architecture Design including AWS Run Rate estimate 
3.  Migration Strategy (including handling of application dependencies)
