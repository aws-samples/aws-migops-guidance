  

Overview
========

At this stage of Portfolio Assessment it is assumed that the activities under **1-Portfolio Discovery and Initial Planning** have been completed or that there is enough data available to work with a subset of prioritized applications in order to perform the assessment. The Prioritized Applications Assessment stage focuses on detailed discovery of a subset of prioritized applications in order to produce an initial AWS Architecture Design and Migration Strategy inclusive of estimated infrastructure run rate in AWS. 

Depending on the strategy chosen for these applications, there could be a significant variation in the level of detail required. For example, most Rehost strategies will require a simple design and less discovery details, the focus will be mainly in validating technology stack compatibility, operations, and security. On the other hand, a Refactor approach will require detailed designs and understanding of the application. Consider adapting the scope of the assessment party, assessment questionnaires and design templates to meet the level of complexity required. Consider also reusing architectural templates/designs that could apply to more than one application of similar characteristics.

Primary Outcomes
================

1.  **AWS Application Architecture Design for prioritized applications**
2.  **Validated Migration Strategy** 
3.  **Estimated Run Rate**
