Goals and Pre-Requisites
========================

The primary outcome of the Discovery Party is to level-up on discovery process, identify the addressable scope, introduce an initial application prioritization criteria, and the installation, configuration, and testing of Discovery Tooling (if applicable), including rolling-out data collection. In order to do so, it is necessary that the sources of data are clearly identified (e.g, if discovery tooling is necessary, then a suitable Discovery Tool has been procured and approved for deployment). Also, it is key that the requirements for tooling deployment, as well as the technical particularities of the environment where the tool will be deployed, are considered in advance. For example, deployment methods, authentication requirements, security zones, firewall rules, infrastructure provisioning, etc.

It is recommended to conduct a ~2-hour workshop, 2 to 3 weeks in advance as a minimum, in order to explore existent sources of data, discuss tooling requirements, options and procurement cycles, and to obtain an extract of an existent application and infrastructure inventory (if possible). This could be a CMDB extract. This information is key to determine whether a discovery tool is required at this stage and what are the recommended options. Discovery tooling differs in terms of the platforms and operating systems they support. It is key to ensure the tooling choice is suitable for the addressable scope.

Activity Details
----------------

| Day | Session | Details / Guidance | Artifacts and Resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Day 1** | Opening and Goal Setting | Level-up customer on the overall Portfolio Assessment methodology and the role of the Portfolio Parties as a first step to Portfolio Assessment setting the basis to further iteration. |   **DK-PortfolioAssessment** (see presentation deck)  **0-Portfolio Roadmap** |
| Business Drivers | Document primary business drivers for the migration/modernization project. Use it to document the primary outcomes at a high-level. For example, Cost Reduction of X%, Transformation of X% of the scope, Risk reduction due to <reasons>. Where possible, avoid long discussions. This is a short session to discuss and document high-level drivers that can be iterated post-party if needed. | **Artifact - Business Drivers and Technical Guiding Principles** |
| Application/Infrastructure Data Requirements, and Data Repository |   Use this session to socialize, review and clarify the application and infrastructure attributes that will be required at each stage of discovery, emphasizing which attributes are required now and which attributes will be gathered in an iterative manner as the project progresses.  Clarify the attributes that are not necessarily provided by the discovery tool of choice. For example, proprietary application names, business units, application owners contact details, physical location, criticality, and others. This is in order to prepare key stakeholders in advance should they need to gather or prepare this information ahead of the Preliminary Analysis.  In addition, use this session to establish a centralized repository for all discovery data (e.g., **Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory**, or the discovery tool database). This will be the single source of truth for all teams to refer to a common place where to review and update data during the migration project. The established repository will be a key artifact for managing the migration scope (e.g., control scope changes).  The repository can take different shapes and forms depending the tooling available. In some cases it will be advisable to keep the data in the discovery tooling database, especially when this is flexible enough to include custom attributes. In other cases, a CSV or Spreadsheet file can be used (template provided).   | **Data Collection Requirements (all stages)****Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory** |
| Addressable Application/Infrastructure Scope |   In order to perform the preliminary analysis, it is key to understand which systems are in scope for discovery. Likewise, when discovery tooling is being used, it is key to understand which systems will be targeted for data collection. This session is for the owner(s) of the target environment for discovery to walk AWS/Partners through their application and infrastructure scope.  For example, if there is a scope of 1000 servers but only 500 are in-scope to be migrated it is likely that only those 500 need to be discovered at this stage. This will accelerate data collection.  There could be situations in which there is no certainty about which applications or servers are in a given data center. In these cases, obtaining bare metal and hypervisor lists will be helpful. Connecting to hypervisors permits to obtain lists of virtual machines to be targeted for data collection. Alternatively, known network subnets could be targeted for automated discovery. Discovery tools can scan those subnets and report those systems that respond to ping or SNMP requests. Note that it is key to understand what the tooling requirements are for this type of discovery given that not all network/systems configurations will allow ping or SNMP traffic.   |   Obtain an updated CMDB extract and/or inventory  **Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory** |
| Application Prioritization Criteria |   The goal of this session is to establish which key attributes will determine the order in which applications should be migrated. This is a key input for identifying initial migration candidates.  If the Discovery Tool of choice lacks the capability/features to perform prioritization or if discovery tooling is not available, use the Migration Portfolio Assessment (MPA) tool (available to AWS Employees and Partners). It will be required to export all application and infrastructure data from its current repository and import it into MPA. Request permission from the data owner(s) to upload inventory data to MPA.   When exporting data, consider exporting all assets (applications and infrastructure), as well as Communication (or dependency) data. The communications data will be required later on for analyzing dependency groups in MPA and constructing wave plans. Once the data has been imported into MPA, navigate to the Plan section, application prioritization.  Note: at this early stage of discovery, the objective is to use a default application prioritization criteria and socialize it with the key stakeholders.  The result will be a ranking of applications. If the weighting/relevance is correct, the top 5 should be good initial candidates for migration. If the top applications do not make sense, adjust the criteria and recreate the list.   |   Discovery Tool of choice  [Link to MPA](http://mpa-proserve.amazonaws.com/)  **Artifact - Application Prioritization Criteria** |
| Wrap-up Day 1 | Review outcomes of the day and next steps |     |
| **Day 2** | Opening and Goal Setting | Establish goals for the day and address any open item |     |
| Data Collection Roll-out Plan |   It is unlikely that the discovery tool will be collecting data from all targeted systems by the end of the Discovery Party. Likewise, if a discovery tool is not being used, data collection will typically require more time and manual effort.  In general, data collection (and agent install, if required) will follow a progressive approach throughout several days or weeks. Clarify these aspects and plan for the roll-out accordingly. Data collection is a key input for the upcoming Portfolio Analysis Party and it is recommended to obtain at least 1 or 2 weeks of discovery data from all targeted systems before conducting a data analysis.   |   Obtain an updated CMDB extract or inventory   **Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory** |
| Discovery Tooling Installation & Configuration (if required) |   The goal of this session is to work alongside the customer to install, configure, and test the Discovery Tool of choice. This is applicable to installation of the main tooling infrastructure and software.   Where possible, start data collection during the party targeting the first chunk of systems as defined in the roll-out plan. Consider that rolling out discovery tooling requires troubleshooting, especially related to security constraints such as authentication, permissions and firewall rules. Ensure that key stakeholders such as InfoSec and Platform teams are actively engaged.  This guide includes runbooks for commonly used Discovery Tooling. However, there are several other tools available. If the tool of choice is not included in the provided artifact, please refer to the vendor installation guide.   | **DK-Portfolio Runbooks** |
| Wrap-up Discovery Party | Review of Party outcomes and next steps (e.g., ad-hoc sessions to iterate/finalize elements of the agenda) |     |
