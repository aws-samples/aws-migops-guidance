Overview
========

Data collection is the process of gathering metadata from applications and infrastructure. The process is iterative throughout all stages of assessment where data quantity and fidelity will increase as progress is made. At this stage, the focus is on gathering general data that can help to establish an initial inventory leading to the creation of a directional business case and the identification of initial migration candidates. The objective of this group of activities is to complete the data collection roll-out (i.e., discovery tool collecting data from all targeted systems) and monitor its progress, collect manual information from infrastructure assets that cannot be targeted by the discovery tool (e.g., legacy systems, secure zones), and to collect application metadata.

Pre-requisites Checklist
------------------------

- 

Discovery Tool installed and configured (or alternative sources identified and validated)

-  Data Collection roll-out plan defined (including agent roll-out when needed) -  Stakeholders for application metadata identified

Activity List
=============

| Activity | Details / Guidance | Artifacts and Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monitor programmatic data collection | Ensure data collection is progressing and that any issues are being actively addressed. Assist the customer with obtaining support from the tooling vendor if required. |   Discovery Tool of choice   |
| Manual Infrastructure discovery |   In most environments there will be cases where the discovery tool of choice does not support a given legacy system. For example, old operating system versions, legacy platforms such as AS400 or Mainframe, etc. If these systems are in-scope for migration, recommend and perform manual discovery. This could require connecting to those systems directly, or the use of scripts that can be obtained from the discovery tooling vendor, platform teams or by specialized AWS practices. Conduct manual discovery workshops if/when necessary.   | **Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory** |
| Application Metadata |   Work with the relevant teams to identify key application attributes such as application names, mapped infrastructure, environments, criticality, complexity, and others. Use the ongoing output of the discovery tool where possible in order to label auto-discovered applications.  Leverage Migration Portfolio Assessment (MPA) tool (available to AWS Employees and Partners) functionality to send customized online questionnaires to ingest application data whenever possible.   | **Data Collection Requirements (all stages)****Template - Application and Infrastructure Inventory**  [MPA tool](http://mpa-proserve.amazonaws.com/)   |
