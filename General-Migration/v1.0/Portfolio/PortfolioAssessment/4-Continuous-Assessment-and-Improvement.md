Overview
========

At this stage of Portfolio Assessment it is assumed that the activities under **1-Portfolio Discovery and Initial Planning**, **2-Prioritized Applications Assessment**, and **3-Portfolio Analysis and Migration Planning**  have been completed. Typically, all Mobilize activities to establish platform, security, and operational foundations would have been completed as well. The Continuous Assessment and Improvement stage focuses on detailed wave discovery by performing detailed application assessments (Detailed Discovery, AWS Design, and Migration Strategy) for the applications in-scope of a given wave. The wave assessment activities can be repeated sequentially until program completion. In addition, this stage focuses on performing detailed assessments of migrated workloads for further optimization, and to iterate/validate migration wave plans when necessary.

Pre-Requisites
==============

*   Platform, Operations, Security, and Migration Factory foundations in place, validated, and tested.
*   Portfolio Level data available, including Application and Infrastructure inventory.
*   Baselined Migration Wave Plan.

|   Wave Application Assessment   |   When migrating/modernizing at scale, it is important to assess applications closer to the migration date whilst still allowing for enough time to adjust cut-over plans and platform requirements. The main goal of this activity is to focus on the applications that compose a given wave, perform detailed assessment, and create/validate the target AWS Design and Migration Strategy in readiness for migration.  **Note:** depending on the strategy chosen for the applications in the wave, there could be significant variation in the level of detail required. For example, most Rehost strategies will require a simple design and less discovery details, the focus will be mainly in validating technology stack compatibility, operations, and security. On the other hand, a Refactor approach will require detailed designs and understanding of the application. Consider adapting the scope of the assessment party, assessment questionnaires and design templates to meet the level of complexity required. Consider also reusing architectural templates/designs that could apply to more than one application of similar characteristics.   |   **2.1-Application Assessment Party**      |
|   Validate/Iterate Wave Plan and Dependency Groups   | Continue to iterate/adapt wave planning based on lessons learnt and changing circumstances. | **Wave Planning**    |
| Optimization | Gather information from AWS Services and Application Owners, including business outcomes (e.g., cost reduction, innovation). Perform a redesign of a group of applications in AWS for further optimization. | **2.1-Application Assessment Party** |

Primary Outcomes
================

1.  **AWS Application Architecture Design for Wave n**
2.  **Validated Migration Strategy for Wave n**
3.  **Iterated/Validated Wave Plan and Dependency Groups**
4.  **Optimization of a group of applications**
