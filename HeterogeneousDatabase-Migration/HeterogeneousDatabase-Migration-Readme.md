## AWS MigOps

AWS MigOps is a new experience and capabilities in AWS Migration Hub that streamlines migrations and helps execute migrations into AWS at scale. As part of this new experience, guidance for multiple templates would be available for customers. Templates and guidance would be made public for customers to leverage or create new versions of them.

#### Heterogeneous Database Migration

You can use this template for heterogeneous migrations into the AWS portfolio of data stores. The template guides you through using services such as AWS Database Migration Service and AWS Schema Coversion Tool to help you meet your database migration goals.
