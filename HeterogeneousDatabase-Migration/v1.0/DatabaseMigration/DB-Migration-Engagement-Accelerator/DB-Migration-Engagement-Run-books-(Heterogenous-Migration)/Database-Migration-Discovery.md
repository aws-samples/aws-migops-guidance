### **Objective**

The DBMigration Discovery is an important phase where the team does a deep dive into the database to be migrated. During the discovery phase key aspects of the database such as dependencies with other databases, data feed jobs, replication, etc are identified and documented.

For any database that is in scope for migration, a deep dive is conducted where the customer team who owns that database walks through the Database and its associated dependencies. During this time, the AWS Team also walks through DB Discovery Questionnaire with the customer team to get more information on the database.

Based on the data gathered from the deep dive, the AWS Consultants go back to white board and plan on how to migrate the database, understand complexities, run Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to understand the manual work that needs to be performed based on SCT Reports, review object counts, estimate data load, code conversion, and unit testing effort. All of this data is consolidated into an estimation template which is later used to present to the customer team.

The team also spends time in documenting the to be state, in scope, out of scope, risks and assumptions which is presented and provided to the customer teams for discussion and review.
