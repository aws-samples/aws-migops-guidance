### Objective

Running the Schema Conversion Tool is the first step towards migration of a database from its Source database to the Target database. Typically, during this process a JSON Mapping file is also created based on custom conversions for that particular database. This can made as a common JSON Mapping file to be used for all the database migrations in the customer environment. In case of any challenges in migration using the tool, they are resolved either manually or automation. AWS Extension pack is also installed on target environment based on the source database requirement. Once Schema is converted constraints, views, triggers etc are created manually in case not created by SCT automatically.

Once all conversions are completed and tested against the source system a comprehensive documentation is created with respect to schema conversion.
