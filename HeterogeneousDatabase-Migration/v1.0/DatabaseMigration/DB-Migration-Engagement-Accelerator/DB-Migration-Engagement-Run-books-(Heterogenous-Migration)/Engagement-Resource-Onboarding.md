### Objective

Resource Onboarding is an important task in the Project Kickoff phase since this determines the availability of the team by the kickstart of the project. The SOW document acts as key input to come up with budget and resource forecast or planning. Resource forecasting should be aligned with the project budget based on which the team(s) size should be scaled up or down through out the life of the project.

Resource onboarding should be planned according to the following -

1.  Overall Project Timeline
    
2.  Wave Plan and Pipeline
    

The following activities need to be performed to identify and onboard resources -

1.  Raise Resource Request into SFDC (identify technology stack required, preferred start date, duration of assignment, expertise level required etc)
    
2.  Work with respective Resource Manager(s), Practice Manager(s) to identify availability of resources based on required timeline.
    
3.  On identifying a resource and updated in SFDC, fill in the resource onboarding details that needs to be sent out the customer to onboard into the client environment. Sample resource onboarding template can be found in the templates section.
    
4.  This activity has to be planned and completed 3-4 weeks prior start date of the resource since Client onboarding might take more than a week based on their operational requirements.
