### Objective

DB Migration Handover is similar to a Sprint Review or Show and Tell where the team involved in migrating the database showcases the migrated database and walks through the process of migration, SCT and DMS tasks, issues faced, resolutions provided, changes to schema definitions made, new indexes created etc..

This is also documented as a Handover Summary Document and provided to the Customer Team so that it will act as a deployment guide for further environments such as Staging/UAT and Production.
