This page contains Project level Risks and Issues managed in Jira.

**Approach for Managing Risks & Issues**
----------------------------------------

### Recommended Statuses

Even though Jira offers many different Status options the preferred status options to be used are:

*   Open
    
*   In Progress (to be used if actions are underway to mitigate the risk or resolve the issue)
    
*   Monitor (To be used for Risks only)
    
*   Closed
    

### Recommended RAG Status Legend

*   **Red** \= There is no agreed mitigation/action plan
    
*   **Amber** \= Agreed mitigation/action plan in place and currently in progress
    
*   **Green** \= Agreed mitigation/action plan on track or under control and being monitored
