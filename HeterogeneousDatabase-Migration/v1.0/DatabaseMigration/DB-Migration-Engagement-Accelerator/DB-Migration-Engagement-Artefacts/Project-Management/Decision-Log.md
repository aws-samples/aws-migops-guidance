|   **Architectural Decisions** are design decisions that address architecturally significant requirements and influence and impact the non-functional characteristics of an IT system.  If the team needs to make a technology decision that will impact the non-functional characteristics of a solution and is typically difficult or costly to change later, or have a problem that requires a design pattern that doesn’t currently exist, please document an Architectural Decision below.  Examples of Architectural Decisions include:  *   Decisions on new software or software packages      *   Endorsement of new design patterns within the Qantas environment      *   Solutions that involve trade-offs      *   New interfaces      *   New data sources for reports       To create a new AD, click the _**Create Architecture Decision.**_   |
