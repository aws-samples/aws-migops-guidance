This document (CustomerXX\_Program Planning.xlsx) provides a template to plan a large scale DB Migration (a 1+ year program) in waves. You can customise wave to a frequency of choice. The wave should determine an iterative go live and fail fast mechanism to ensure a big bang go live is avoided also so that, we fail fast and plan quick wins in alignment with customerâ€™s roadmap/go live plans.

The wave planning document assumes a 1+ year program, for which we need to provide the frequency of wave, in order to calculate the expected number of waves. This also aligns with a timeline and calculates the timeline for all waves based on start date entered.
