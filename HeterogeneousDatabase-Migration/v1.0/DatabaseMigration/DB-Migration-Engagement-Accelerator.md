### **Objective**

The Database Migration Delivery Team Playbook was developed to accelerate delivery and reduce risk for AWS ProServe engagements by leveraging best practices and lessons learnt from ProServe GCC Database Migration projects delivered. The Playbook provides prescriptive guidance that can be used to accelerate delivery for all Database Migration engagements, whether the engagement uses an existing DB Migration ProServe Offering or has a custom scope. This Delivery Kit assumes the infrastructure setup on AWS Cloud is taken care of by the DevOps team or the Customer Teams, while AWS team is focusing on the Database migration.
