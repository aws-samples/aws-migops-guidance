# Migration spaces<a name="migration-spaces"></a>

A migration space is a logical container for organizing migration journeys\. It is also a logical container for two types of members: individuals and teams\.

To view your migration spaces, go to the Migration Hub console, and in the navigation pane on the left, choose **Migration spaces**\. You can view the spaces of which you are a member, either as an administrator or a contributor\.

For information about the roles that you can have in a migration space and the actions that those roles allow you to perform, see [Roles and permissions](permissions.md)\.
