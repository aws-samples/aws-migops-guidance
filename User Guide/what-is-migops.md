# What is AWS MigOps?<a name="what-is-migops"></a>

AWS MigOps is an [AWS Migration Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/) service that you can use to plan, perform, and track migrations into AWS\. AWS MigOps combines the tools that are available in AWS Migration Hub with the latest guidance from [AWS Prescriptive Guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance), documentation, and other sources\. You don't need an AWS account to use AWS MigOps\.

The core concept in AWS MigOps is the migration journey, which is a pipeline of migration\-related tasks that you can assign to different teams or individuals\. You can create a journey from scratch or from one of the templates that AWS MigOps provides\. These templates represent common migration scenarios and follow best practices\. If you create your journey from a template, you can customize the journey to better match your particular scenario\. The following diagram provides an overview of how AWS MigOps works\.
