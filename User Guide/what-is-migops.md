A core concept in Migration Hub is the migration journey, which is a pipeline of migration\-related tasks that you can assign to different teams or individuals\. You can create a journey from scratch or from one of the templates that Migration Hub provides\. These templates represent common migration scenarios and follow best practices\. If you create your journey from a template, you can customize the journey to better match your particular scenario\. The following diagram provides an overview of how Migration Hub journeys work\.
