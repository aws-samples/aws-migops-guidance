A migration journey can have two types of members: individuals and teams\. A member, whether an individual or a team, can have one of two roles in a journey: `JourneyAdmin` or `JourneyContributor`\. For information about these two roles and the actions that they allow a journey member to perform, see [Roles and permissions](permissions.md)\.
