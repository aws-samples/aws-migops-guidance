# What is Expert Help?<a name="what-is-expert-help"></a>

Expert Help is a new AWS MigOps feature that you can use to request assistance from AWS experts for migration projects that require a high degree of expertise\. Expert Help makes this assistance available in the form of discrete help packages that you can request for your migration journey or for specific modules or tasks in the journey\. The following three types of help packages are available\.
+ **Task assistance:**This type of package assumes that you have read the documentation and started the task, but then gotten stuck\. You have questions and need guidance, reviews, or live assistance to complete the task\. The expert will provide guidance, but you are expected to carry out most of the work\.
+ **Advice:**This type of package provides an overview and basic knowledge of a specific topic where you can seek advice and guidance and ask scenario\-based questions\. By the end of the help, youâ€™ll have a better picture of how to move forward with a clear plan of action\.
+ **Full service:**In this type of package, most of the work is completed by an expert who provides full hands\-on service from beginning to end\. You provide initial data and the access required by the expert and the expert takes care of the rest\.

As you progress through a migration journey, you will see an Expert Help icon whenever a help package is available\. For example, if you are working on creating a directional business case as part of a migration project, you will see the suitcase icon shown in the following image\. This means that a help package is available for this module\. You can then choose that icon to submit a help request\. An AWS service representative will then contact you within 24 hours to begin the help process\.
