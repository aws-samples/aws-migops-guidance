# Migration assessment with Migration Evaluator<a name="pkg-mig-assess-with-mig-evaluator"></a>

A business case is the first step in a successful cloud migration journey\. Get started with a complimentary migration assessment that is customized to your current IT landscape\. [Migration Evaluator](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-evaluator/) uses your real\-time utilization and performance data to analyze cost estimations for you to run your workloads in the AWS Cloud\. Our customers have identified savings of up to 50% versus their on\-premises infrastructure\.

With Migration Evaluator, you gain the insights to build a cloud migration plan with confidence and to accelerate decision\-making for migration to AWS\.

## Prerequisites<a name="prereqs"></a>
+ You have read and reviewed the open source guides to get a basic understanding of the task\.
+ You have subscribed to the AMS Accelerate plan, AWS Premium Support, the AWS Migration Acceleration Program \(MAP\), or similar programs\.
+ You must be a start\-up or SMB customer\.
+ You must grant the [JourneyContributor](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/User%20Guide/roles.md#journeycontributor) role in MigOps to the expert\.

## Deliverables<a name="deliverables"></a>
+ Quick Insights report: The Migration Evaluator Quick Insights report is the first deliverable in a Migration Evaluator assessment\. With the Quick Insights report, you receive a customized one\-page report with the projected costs to run your on\-premises estate in the AWS Cloud\. Within hours of deploying the on\-premises agentless collector or uploading your existing data, your Quick Insights report is available\. It provides a summary of the number of servers that the analysis includes and the projected costs to rehost in AWS based on usage patterns\. The report also breaks down costs by infrastructure and software licenses\. With these insights, you can adjust discovery strategies early in the project and level\-set the business case before assessment is complete\. The Quick Insights report is available globally for customers at no additional charge\.
+ Business case: If you request additional insights after you review the Quick Insights report, the Migration Evaluator Team will deliver a directional business case\. Migration Evaluator simplifies the on\-premises analysis of compute, storage, memory, and Microsoft licenses with algorithms to determine the best\-fit, lowest\-cost placement for each workload in AWS\. The migration business case consolidates these insights\. It estimates on\-premises cost, proposes multiple future\-state cost\-modeling scenarios, and analyzes ways to optimize Windows and SQL Server licensing\. Your help package presents these insights and recommends Cloud Value Framework, VMC modeling, and Elastic Disaster Recovery Service options\. You get this in a data\-forward template that outlines prescriptive next steps in an accessible format\. You can optionally supplement your business case with storage assessment and server dependency mapping\.
