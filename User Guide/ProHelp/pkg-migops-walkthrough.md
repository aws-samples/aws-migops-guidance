### What are the main components of MigOps?<a name="migops-components"></a>

With MigOps, you create migration spaces as containers to group related migration journeys\. You can add individuals as administrators or contributors to a migration space\. An administrator can create and manage journeys in the space\. A contributor can work on individual tasks in a journey\. A space can contain multiple migration journeys that help operationalize migrations across multiple teams\. Each journey consists of phases, such as Assess, Mobilize, Migrate, and Operate\. Each phase includes modules that target a specific outcome, such as creating a directional business case, or a migration readiness assessment\. Each module consists of tasks that provide explicit instructions on how to complete the task and meet the outcome\. A task consists of discrete instructions and can contain subtasks\. 

### How can MigOps help me collaborate with various migration practitioners?<a name="migops-roles"></a>

MigOps defines the following set of roles:
+ Migration space administrator
+ Migration space contributor
+ Journey administrator
+ Journey contributor
+ Team contributor

You can use these roles to control access to resources and actions\. Administrators can create a journey and add partners, AWS employees, and other team members as journey contributors\. An individual’s role determines the parts of the migration journey that they can access\. Administrators are typically project leads, and can assign individual tasks to experts\. For example, an administrator can assign a database migration task to a database expert\. For delayed or blocked tasks, MigOps sends automatic email messages to notify experts of all the risks involved\. A task is considered complete when the work by the experts meets the acceptance criteria that are defined for the task\. For example, experts can’t complete a task to generate a business case unless they also upload the final business case deck to the MigOps artifact management system\.
