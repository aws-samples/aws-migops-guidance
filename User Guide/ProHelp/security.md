## Who can request expert help?<a name="requesting-packages"></a>

To request expert help for a module or a task, you must have either the [JourneyContributor](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/User%20Guide/roles.md#journeycontributor) or [JourneyAdmin](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-migops-guidance/blob/main/User%20Guide/roles.md#journeyadmin) role in the migration journey that includes that module or task\.

## Viewing active help requests<a name="viewing-requests"></a>

**To view all the help requests that you have submitted**

1. Open the Expert Help console at [https://prod.us-east-2.console.migops.migration-services.aws.dev/](https://prod.us-east-2.console.migops.migration-services.aws.dev/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Expert help**, then choose **Requests**\.

You can only see the help requests that you have submitted\. You can't see help requests submitted by other members of the migration journey\. However, if you try to request a help package that another journey member has already requested, a notification like the one shown in the following image will appear in the right pane\.
