# Migration tooling setup assistance<a name="pkg-mig-tooling-setup-assist"></a>

This package has the following goals: 1\) To build the foundation that all other work streams use to structure and prioritize work, collaborate, document knowledge, and report progress; 2\) To help customers establish the appropriate methods and tools to plan and perform their migration journey using AWS best practices; and 3\) To set up collaboration and planning mechanisms that implement and automate many [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/) activities\. 

We will help you set up collaboration and governance mechanisms to manage cloud operations beyond the migration\. Mechanisms might include an agile operations workflow, an IT governance decision catalog, and a video library\. We'll also help you stablish and exercise an agile program to accelerate cloud operational readiness and cloud migrations\.

## Prerequisites<a name="prereqs"></a>
+ Pilot only: You must already use one of the supported platforms, either Atlassian Cloud or Azure DevOps Services\.
+ Beyond the pilot: You have secured licensing to a third\-party SaaS product such as Atlassian Cloud or Azure DevOps, and are willing to obtain security approval to use these tools to manage migration efforts\. 
+ You have reviewed the Workshop Studio content to get a basic understanding of the task\.
+ You can grant the expert access to the installed tool\. Alternatively, you can share your screen with the expert and show them your scenario\.

## Deliverables<a name="deliverables"></a>
+ End\-to\-end roadmap: An agile roadmap that links business stakeholder needs to technology initiatives\. 
+ Complete backlog: A refined, well\-prioritized backlog for the scope of the engagement\.

## Steps<a name="steps"></a>

1. Participate in a 1\-hour Immersion Day workshop led by an expert\.

1. Participate in a 2\-hour workshop with the expert to install all of the backlogs and artifacts\.
   + Establish a base\-lined knowledge management system and a library for meeting recordings\.
   + Establish a base\-lined decision catalog for IT governance\.
   + Establish a migration program dashboard and a reporting mechanism\.

1. The expert will share deliverables with you via email\. After you receive all the deliverables from the expert, review and accept the expertâ€™s work\.

## FAQ<a name="faq"></a>

### What is a video library?<a name="vid-lib"></a>

All sprint ceremonies and workstream sessions are recorded\. Recordings capture screen sharing and audio, and this ensures visibility and knowledge transfer for either existing or new team members\. This mechanism removes engagement blockers because you can still meet without all stakeholders present\.

### What is a knowledge base?<a name="kb"></a>

A knowledge base is a dynamic resource that all members of IT \(and potentially the broader organization\) can use to run operations and carry out strategic initiatives\. The knowledge base serves as a single place to collaborate and bring a work product through a governance process for customer acceptance\. The completed knowledge base represents an online, self\-service library that includes all relevant operational artifacts and runbooks\. At the end of the Mobilize phase, the knowledge base will encapsulate all technical and business artifacts that were developed and can be used as a reference and training guidance for existing and new team members\. Currently, the delivery kits that seed the knowledge base are in Confluence format, and additional formats are targeted for future releases\.

### What is an IT Governance Decision Catalog?<a name="gov-decision-catalog"></a>

The IT Governance Decision Catalog is an online tool that you host in your environment so you can track your decisions throughout your cloud migration journey\. This mechanism helps facilitate your decision workflow and serves as a historical record\. All stakeholders involved in the project can access this catalog\. They can request decisions, make recommendations, and view final decisions\. The recommended workflow helps you manage two\-way door decisions\. With this workflow, you learn to use data and documentation to support decisions and overcome blockers\.
