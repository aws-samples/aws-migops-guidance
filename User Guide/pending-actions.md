In Migration Hub you can receive the following types of invitations:
+ An invitation to become a member of a migration space\.
+ An invitation to join a team in a migration space\.
+ An invitation to become a member of a migration journey\.
+ A request to accept the transfer of a migration journey\.

When someone sends you an invitation, you receive an email that includes a button that you can use to respond to the invitation\. That button takes you to the **Pending actions** page of the Migration Hub console\. On that page, you can accept or reject each invitation\.
